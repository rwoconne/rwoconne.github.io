</center>


<p><br></p>

<b>

<ul>

<li>  Prepare observing sheets and finding charts <u>BEFORE YOU ARRIVE
AT LAB</u>.  TA's can refuse you access to lab is you haven't prepared.</p>

<li> Telescope properly mounted; polar axis oriented to North; RA
	and DEC circles properly zeroed (if using); telescope unclamped</p>

<li> Lens caps removed</p>

<li> Finder focused</p>

<li> <u>Finder and main scope co-aligned</u>.  Check on terrestrial
	targets, moon, or bright star.  Objects in the center of main
	scope under high power should be on cross hairs of finder.  If
	not, realign the finder and main telescope (ask TA's for help
        the first time). </p>

<li>	<u>Lowest power</u> eyepiece (i.e.  <u>longest</u> focal length) in
	main scope.  <u>Tighten</u> set screw so that eyepiece cannot
	slip.</p>

<li>	Main scope focused (check on terrestrial target or bright star 
	field)</p>

<li>	<u>Telescope unclamped</u></p>

<li>	Have finding chart/sky map identifying target or RA and DEC coordinates
        available.  Know what the target should look like when you locate it.</p>

<li>  Target finding methods:</p>

<ul>


<li>  Boresighting:</p>

<ul>		
		
  <li> Use binoculars to locate general field (optional) <br>
	
  <li> Move telescope to vicinity of target<br>

  <li> Take care to minimize parallax between your
		      eyeline and finder<br>

  <li> Center target in finder; use cross hairs<br>

  <li> Clamp telescope carefully (don't disturb pointing)<br>

  <li> <u>Double check</u> position against sky map and/or
			binoculars</p>

</ul>


<li> Star-hopping:</p>

<ul>  

<li>  Boresight to an easy reference object<br>
<li>  With telescope unclamped, move in a series of small steps through
      intermediate reference objects (located in the finder or main
      eyepiece) to the target<br>
<li>  You need a <u>good</u> star chart to use this method</p>

</ul>

<li> One-axis slewing:</p>

<ul>

<li> Look up another object which lies at the same RA or DEC as your
target.  Set on that by boresighting or star-hopping.<br>

<li> Clamp the axis for the coordinate in common<br>

<li> Carefully offset the other axis while looking through the finder
or main eyepiece to locate the target<br>

<li>  You do not have to zero the coordinate dials to use this method.</p>

</ul>


<li> RA, DEC coordinates: </p>

<ul>

<li>  Look up target coordinates.  If your telescope does not read
directly in RA, you will need to compute the HA (for the time you
estimate you will have the telescope set) from the ST and the
target's RA.<br>

<li> Move the telescope (one coordinate at a time) until proper
coordinates are read on dials.  (The dials must have been properly
zeroed beforehand by setting on a bright reference star.) <br>

<li> Clamp  telescope carefully (don't disturb pointing)<br>

<li> <u>Double check coordinate dials</u><br>

<li>  Instead of setting both coordinates, you can set just one (DEC
is best), then do a  one-axis slew to the target while looking through
the eyepiece.</p>

</ul>
</ul>

<li>  Be sure the telescope is clamped</p>

<li> 	Check for the target in the main telescope; if not there, <u>unclamp</u>
	and systematically repeat the steps for finding the target.</p>

<li>  If using RA,DEC and the target is not in telescope, check
        calibration of <u>both</u> coordinate dials using a relatively 
        nearby bright star.  If you can't find the target after a second
        try, check that the coordinates you are using are correct. </p>

<li>	Go to higher power eyepiece only after confirming target in
	low power and centering carefully. Be sure to loosen and
	tighten set screw for eyepiece appropriately.</p>


</ul>
