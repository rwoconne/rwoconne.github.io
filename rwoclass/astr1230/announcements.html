All work is now graded, and final grades are posted on the
Collab/PostEm site.  The class performed unusually well, even in the
face of a record-setting run of bad weather.

Contact TA Aaron if you would like to see any graded work that we
still have.

Have a great holiday!  

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
11/28/11

Hope everyone had a good Thanksgiving & break.  

The weather was beautiful here in CV Thursday & Friday.  Regretably,
the bad weather has returned just in time for the last six nights of
ASTR 1230 observing.  Tonight and tomorrow are a wipe-out, although
both Wednesday and Thursday are potentially good.  We will be open if
there is any chance of getting decent observations.

We will remove this Friday's deadline for submitting Lab 4, but that
only gives you two more nights to complete it.  We cannot offer
observing after the night of Tuesday, Dec. 6.

All course work is due WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7 at 5 PM.  

Turn labs in to the ASTR 1230 submission box in the west corridor of
the Astronomy Building.  Alternatively, you can put them in my mailbox
in the Astro Dept main office.

If you have not submitted some of your work on time, remember that the
penalty for late work is only 15% of the grade.  It is much better to
get 85% of the credit for a late assignment than to get a zero because
you never submitted it.

To remind yourself of details on the optional labs, see the 10/31
announcement posted below.  The Moon Lab can probably be done
successfully through next Tuesday.

Grades for Optional Lab 1 should be posted by this Friday.  You
can pick up Lab 3 at the observatory office whenever it is open.

LAB LOGISTICS

LAB 4:  choose 6 objects from the "Fall" list and 4 additional
    objects from the complete list of objects in Lab 4.  You can
    include the Moon (if up) and Jupiter among the 4 additional targets.  

FIRST OPTIONAL LAB.  You can choose 300 points worth of
optional labs from Lab 5 or higher in the Manual, in any combination.
They could all be CLEA (computer) labs.

Notes on OPTIONAL LABS:  

   Be sure to WRITE THE DATE on which you SUBMITTED your lab on the front
   of the lab paper.

   You must finish Lab 3 before doing any other telescope observing labs.
   But you DON'T need to finish Lab 3 before doing other optional labs. 

   Lab 5/Moon:  depends on lunar phase.  do the Moon Lab either:

                     Mon - Thurs 10/31 - 11/3  OR 
                     Mon - Thurs 11/28 - 12/1 

       As an aid to locating important features on the Moon's
       surface, download the lunar map posted to the course
       website: 
       www.faculty.virginia.edu/rwoclass/astr1230/4-plate-moon-map.pdf
         
   Lab 7/Telescope Observing II: if you are comfortable with the
       computerized system on the telescopes, this lab is relatively
       straightforward.  Requires a total of 12 objects spread over
       several categories.  Most observations will require clear, dark
       skies.

   Lab 8/Astrophotography:

       If interested, even if you're not sure you will do it, sign up
       by email to TA AARON (amk6zm) BY THIS WEDNESDAY.  He will arrange
       a joint orientation session.  After the orientation, you can
       sign out camera equipment during regular lab hours.  You can
       use it anywhere as long as you bring it back by 11 PM.

       See the "Orientation" link on Lec 7 webpage for an idea of
       what you'll be doing.  

   Lab 9/Meteor Showers: the Moon has compromised observations of the
       good showers this Fall.  The Leonid shower (~11/17) can
       sometimes be strong --- but a bright Moon will probably prevent
       good views this year.  Although it's risky, it might be worth a
       try. The Blue Ridge Parkway is a good observing site---but
       don't go alone.  Research likely shower strength on the web
       before deciding.

   Lab 10/Rotation of Sun:  in this lab you make several daytime
       observations of the Sun using a special viewing telescope.  The
       telescope will be available 11 AM - 1 PM on clear days.
       Contact TA BRIAN (bjp5wt) for details.  If you think you
       want to do this lab, alert Brian by this WEDNESDAY.        

   Lab 11: Recreation of classic experiment by Roemer (1675), who made
       a first determination of the speed of light.  Observations
       consisting of timing the eclipses of Jupiter satellite Io.
       Contact TA BRIAN (bjp5wt) for more info.  You must observe on
       specific nights.  We will post a file of times and dates to the
       website.  If you think you want to do this lab, alert Brian by
       this WEDNESDAY.

   Lab 12/Navigation: in this lab, you make sextant observations of
       the Sun over a period of 2 hours.  Contact TA CHRIS (cmi5mw) to
       arrange a day to do the lab.  You need to make several
       observations between 11 AM and 1 PM EST.  If you think you
       want to do this lab, alert Chris by this WEDNESDAY.

  CLEA (computer) labs:

        o Download instructions and data sheets from the Astronomy
          Dept website (http://www.astro.virginia.edu/laboratory-information)

        o Be sure you use the **ASTR 1230 versions** of the labs

        o The interactive software for the CLEA labs can 
          be executed from ITC computers (e.g. in the libraries)
          OR can be downloaded to your own computer from the **UVa
          Hive** system (http://www.itc.virginia.edu/hive/home.html).

          If you encounter trouble with the software, contact
          George Trammell (gbt8f@virginia.edu). 

        o Fill out the data sheets according to the instructions, and
          be sure you SHOW ALL COMPUTATIONS.

        o You **MUST SUBMIT a REGULAR LAB WRITE-UP**, including
          purpose, procedure, and conclusions, in addition to the
          data and computation sheets.

MIDTERM EXAM:  Monday, 10/31

   Exam will be objective.  Please bring pencils to fill out scantron
   forms.

   Also bring Sky Wheels (needed for some questions)

   Review/sample questions were handed out in class and are posted
   on the "Exam Prep" page.  These are in general more difficult than
   the corresponding exam questions.

   We will hold an informal REVIEW SESSION (based on your questions)
   for the exam, SUNDAY, 10/30, at 4 PM in Rm. 265 of the Astronomy
   Building.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
10/17/11

Because the weather has been less than "stellar" this semester,
we are making a change in Lab 3 which should help expedite observations.

Finding Gamma Delphini by bore-sighting is difficult in partly cloudy
or bright skies and also because of its altitude at this time of year.
Instead of bore-sighting, you can use computer-controlled, automated
finding.  This will add the steps listed in Sec 3.8 to the lab, but
these involve bright stars, and there should be a net savings of time
for the latter parts of the lab.

The order of the parts of Lab 3 will therefore change, and you should
MARK UP YOUR MANUALS to correspond to the revision.

Here is the revised order for Lab 3:

      Parts 1-10 

      Parts 18-24   (these parts require the telescope to be
                    powered up but not under computer control) 

      Part 11

      New part 11.5:  Use the instructions in Sec. 3.8 of the Lab
                      manual to calibrate and align the telescope.
                      Then find Gamma Del using the internal 
                      database.  

      Parts 12-17  (these parts involve observations of Gamma Del) 

See the "Schedule/Deadlines" page on the website for changes in lab
deadlines consequent to the poor weather.  

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
8/20/11

The FIRST CLASS MEETING of ASTR 1230 will be Monday, 8/29, at 7 PM in
Clark 107.  We will cover organizational and policy aspects of the
course.  

Your ASSIGNMENT in preparation for this first meeting is to read the
Syllabus and Schedule/Deadline pages on the ASTR 1230 web site
(http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/rwoclass/astr1230/).  Those will
be posted by Wednesday, 8/24. 

This course has a formal Co-Requisite of ASTR 1210 or 1220.  If you
don't meet that requirement, don't worry---as long as you are willing to
do some extra reading for background on particular topics in a
standard ASTR 1210/1220 text.  

Regular labs will not be open until Monday, 9/5.  Each of you has
signed up for a Lab Section on either Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or
Thursday nights.  During the week of 8/29 you must attend the lab at
that time for a nightlab orientation (9:15 PM Monday, 8 PM Tuesday
through Thursday).  Go to the Astronomy 265 classroom for a 60 minute
orientation covering facilities available to you, use of sky wheels,
and lab procedures.  Bring your sky wheel, lab manual, Edmund's
Atlas, and a flashlight.  

Orientation will take place regardless of weather.

After your orientation meeting, you can attend lab on ANY NIGHT when
it is open.

The first regular lecture (on constellations) will be Monday, 9/5. 
HTML versions of the notes for the first lecture will be posted on the
"Lectures" page of the ASTR 1230 website by the preceding Friday.  You
can print out a hardcopy of the notes to bring to class and mark up.

For Lab 1 (Constellations), you will work in groups.  The lab will be
held during THE FIRST TWO CLEAR NIGHTS ON OR AFTER MONDAY 9/5.  You
can come to either night---but you must come to one.  This may mean
some rearrangement of your personal schedule. 

Required materials you need to purchase at Newcomb Bookstore include
the ASTR 1230 Manual, a "sky wheel," and the "Edmund Mag 5 Star
Atlas."  You will also need to have a small flashlight with you at all
laboratory sessions.

See you Monday 8/29
