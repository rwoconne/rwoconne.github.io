This false-color mosaic was constructed from a series of 53
images taken through three spectral filters by Galileo's imaging
system as the spacecraft flew over the northern regions of the
Moon on December 7, 1992.  The part of the Moon visible from
Earth is on the left side in this view.  The color mosaic shows
compositional variations in parts of the Moon's northern
hemisphere.  Bright pinkish areas are highlands materials, such
as those surrounding the oval lava-filled Crisium impact basin
toward the bottom of the picture.  Blue to orange shades indicate
volcanic lava flows.  To the left of Crisium, the dark blue Mare
Tranquillitatis is richer in titanium than the green and orange
maria above it.  Thin mineral-rich soils associated with
relatively recent impacts are represented by light blue colors;
the youngest craters have prominent blue rays extending from
them.  The Galileo project, whose primary mission is the
exploration of the Jupiter system in 1995-97, is managed for
NASA's Office of Space Science and Applications by the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
