Original Caption Released with Image:
     This false-color photograph is a composite of 15 images of the Moon
     taken through three color filters by Galileo's solid- state imaging
     system during the spacecraft's passage through the Earth- Moon system
     on December 8, 1992. When this view was obtained, the spacecraft was
     425,000 kilometers (262,000 miles) from the Moon and 69,000 kilometers
     (43,000 miles) from Earth. The false-color processing used to create
     this lunar image is helpful for interpreting the surface soil
     composition. Areas appearing red generally correspond to the lunar
     highlands, while blue to orange shades indicate the ancient volcanic
     lava flow of a mare, or lunar sea. Bluer mare areas contain more
     titanium than do the orange regions. Mare Tranquillitatis, seen as a
     deep blue patch on the right, is richer in titanium than Mare
     Serenitatis, a slightly smaller circular area immediately adjacent to
     the upper left of Mare Tranquillitatis. Blue and orange areas covering
     much of the left side of the Moon in this view represent many separate
     lava flows in Oceanus Procellarum. The small purple areas found near
     the center are pyroclastic deposits formed by explosive volcanic
     eruptions. The fresh crater Tycho, with a diameter of 85 kilometers (53
     miles), is prominent at the bottom of the photograph, where part of the
     Moon's disk is missing.
