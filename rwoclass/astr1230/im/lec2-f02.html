<h3>A.  THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM</h3>

 <p><br></p>


<!-- <a href = "im/emwave-anim-DZ.gif">  -->

Maxwell (1865) discovered that electric and magnetic forces can 
<a href="http://www.phy.ntnu.edu.tw/java/emWave/emWave.html">
propagate through space</a> at the speed
of light. The immediate inference was that <em>light is an
electromagnetic disturbance.</em> The propagating disturbance moves
through space like a water wave through water and is called an
<em>electromagnetic wave.</em> </p>

<!-- wavelength.gif  -->

<center><img src="im/wave-nomenclature-CM.jpg" border=2></center>
<center><em>Wave Disturbance</em></center>



EM waves are characterized by their <em>wavelengths</em>, or distance
between peaks where the EM forces are strongest.  All wavelengths from
zero to infinity are possible for EM waves, and this total range is
called the <em>EM spectrum</em>.  From longest to shortest
wavelengths, the EM spectrum includes:  <em> Radio, microwaves,
infrared, optical light, ultraviolet light, X-rays, and gamma rays.
</em></p>

The human eye is directly sensitive only to a <em> very small</em>
range of wavelengths in the EM spectrum. This is called the <em>
visible </em> or <em>optical</em> region.  Wavelengths of optical
light are conventionally measured in units of "&Aring;ngstroms" (where
1 &Aring; = 10<sup>-8</sup> cm).  The optical band extends roughly
from wavelengths of 4000 &Aring; in the deep violet to
7000 &Aring; in the deep red. Green light has a wavelength around 5000
&Aring;, or about 0.0005 mm---far smaller than sizes encountered in
everyday life.  Because the wavelength of optical light is so small,
we are not conscious of light's wavelike character.</p>

<center><em>Full EM Spectrum with Visible Spectrum Enlarged<br> (Units marked
are microns.  1 micron = 10<sup>-4</sup>cm =  10,000 &Aring;)</em></center>

<p><br></p>
 

The Earth's atmosphere is <em>opaque</em> to most wavelengths in the
EM spectrum.  This is good for lifeforms on Earth's surface, because
the more energetic types of EM radiation are harmful.  But obviously,
it is not convenient for astronomers who want to monitor the universe
across the full EM spectrum.  (This is the main motivation for space
astronomy.) The chart below shows the ability of different wavelengths
to penetrate the atmosphere.  (Click for enlargement.) </p>

<h3>B. TELESCOPES:  GENERAL  </p></h3>


The telescope is the single most important invention for astronomy.
Without it, we would have almost none of the profound understanding we
have obtained over the last few hundred years about the physical
nature of the universe and its history.</p>

The telescope is a beautiful example of interplay between technology
(fabrication of quality glass, polishing techniques, large mechanical
structures, computers) and basic science.</p>

<ul>

<li> Invented: 1608 (Lippershey, Holland).  [Note: microscope invented
1654, also in Holland.]</p>

<li> First astronomical use: 1610, by 
(<a href="http://es.rice.edu/ES/humsoc/Galileo/index.html">Galileo</a>,
 Italy).  Utterly transformed astronomy.</p>

</ul>

Purposes</p>

<ul>

<li> <i><u>Collect more light</u> from source</i> --- most important </p>

<li> <i>Magnify source</i></p>

<li> <i>Resolve more detail in source</i></p>

</ul>


Basic Principle:</p>

<ul>

<li> An <em>objective</em> or <em>primary</em> optical element forms
an <em>image</em> (i.e. an accurate representation of original scene)
at a usable <em>focus</em>, where it can be studied by eye, recorded
by film or other detectors (as in a camera), or fed into yet other
instruments </p>

</ul>


Objectives: two types</p>

<ul>

<li><u>Lens</u>: transparent glass shaped to <em>refract</em> (or bend)
light rays to a focus.  The image at the left below shows how a flat
glass surface bends light rays (in this case, two surfaces combine to
make a <em>prism</em>.  The shorter the wavelength, the stronger the
bending.  The image at the right shows how a glass surface can be
continuously curved to bring all the light rays passing through it
from a distant object to a common <em>focal point</em>. </p>

</table>
</center>

<p><br></p>

<li><u>Mirror</u>: shaped glass which <em>reflects</em> light rays off its
front surface to a common focus.  See picture below.</p>

</ul>

<center><img src="im/reflect-tel-PF.gif" border=0></center>
<center><em>Reflection of Light by a Figured Mirror</em></center>

<p><br></p>


Focal point:</p>

<ul>

<li> For distant objects (including all astronomical objects), the
incoming rays from each point on the source are parallel to each
other.  In this case, the image is formed at a point which is <em>one
focal length</em> from the objective.  For nearer objects, the
image is formed at a larger distance from the objective.  Click on
the button below for a Java applet illustrating image formation.</p>

</ul>

<!-- ADD? NO: is for nearby object, not infinite;

<center>
<a href="http://www.lightlink.com/sergey/java/java/clens/index.html">
<img src="im/film.gif">Applet</a>
</p>
</center>

<ul>

<li>  Note that the image is <u>inverted</u> with respect to the 
original, as in the drawing below:</p>

<center>
<img src="im/convex-imform2-JFA-sm.jpg">
</center>

</ul>

For visual use:</p>

<ul> <li> A small lens called an <em>eyepiece</em> is used to magnify
the image at the focal point and make the rays parallel again to allow
the eye to form a sharp image of it.  (Although your eye contains a
flexible lens, which can adjust to focus on nearby or distant objects,
the light beam from the objective of a telescope in the absence of an
eyepiece is converging or diverging too strongly for this lens to
correct.) </p>

</ul>

<p><br></p>


<h3>C.  TELESCOPE PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS</h2>

<em>Focal ratio:</em></p>

<ul>

<li>  f/ = (Objective Focal Length)/(Objective Diameter). </p>

<li> The smaller is f/, the more concentrated is the light in the
focal plane and the easier it is to see faint extended objects like
nebulae.  (Same as for the aperture setting on a camera---the smaller
the f/ number, the higher is the brightness in the focal plane.)
Typical small telescopes have f/ in the range 5-20. </p>  

</ul>


<em>Magnification</em> or "power":</p>

<ul>

<li> Defined to be the increase in the apparent <em>angular size</em>
(measured, e.g., in degrees) of the image </p>

<li> Mag = (image size in degrees)/(object size without scope in degrees).</p>

<center>
<img src="im/magnify_ship.jpg">
</center>

<li> For a given telescope, magnification is determined by the
focal length of the eyepiece:</p>

<ul>

Mag = (Focal Length Telescope)/(Focal Length Eyepiece)</p>

Mag = 2000 mm/(FLE) for the Meade 8-in scopes</p>

Note:  high powers (> 150x) are <em>not</em> necessarily better,
except for specialized applications (e.g. planets).  Susceptible
to image blurring by atmosphere, telescope vibration. etc.</p>

</ul></ul>

<em>Field of View</em></p>

<ul>

<li> Defined to be the <em>original</em> angular diameter
of the region viewed through the telescope.  Field of view
decreases as magnification increases.</p>

<li> E.g. with a 20 mm eyepiece, the Meade 8-in scopes produce
a field which is 20 minutes of arc in diameter.  (Compare to the
full Moon, which is 30 min of arc.)</p>

</ul>

<em>Light Gathering Power</em></p>

<ul>

<li> Most important attribute of a telescope</p>

<li> Light collected is proportional to the <em>area of the objective</em>,
which in turn is proportional to its diameter<sup>2</sup>.  </p>

<li> Compare capability of 8-in Meade scope to human eye:</p>

<ul>
Assume pupil diameter of dark-adapted eye is 5 mm.  Meade
objective is 200 mm.  Light gathering capability of 
Meade is then (200/5)<sup>2</sup>  =  (40)<sup>2</sup> =  <u>1600x larger</u> than
eye.  </p>

If eye can detect magnitude 5 stars, the Meade will detect stars of
13th magnitude.  There are over 5,000,000 of these, compared to the
2,000 or so visible with the naked eye! </p>

</ul>
</ul>


<p><br></p>


<!-- <center><img src="im/penny-diffrac.gif" border=2></center>  -->

<center><img src="im/diffrac-aper.gif" border=2></center> 
<center><em>Diffraction</em></center>

<em>Resolution</em></p>

<ul>

<li> Quantitatively defined to be the <u>smallest measurable
detai</u>l in an image (in seconds of arc).  Depends both on 
telescope optics and Earth's atmosphere.</p>

<li> Basic limit is set by the physics of light: since it is a wave
phenomenon, light spreads out or <em>diffracts</em>.  The picture
above shows how light spreads out when it passes through a narrow
aperture, such as the objective lens of a telescope.  Because of the
interference of light waves from different parts of the aperture, the
larger the aperture, the more <em>concentrated</em> the emerging beam,
implying better resolution.</p>

<!-- The picture above shows diffraction around the edges of a
penny.</p> -->

<!--

href="http://www.colorado.edu/UCB/AcademicAffairs/ArtsSciences/physics/PhysicsInitiative/Physics2000/applets/twoslitsa.html">Young
2-slit experiment applet.</a></p> 
-->

<li> The resolution is proportional to (Wavelength/Objective Diameter).
The larger the telescope, the better the resolution.  </p>

<li> A 10-in diameter telescope with perfect optics will produce a 1
arc-sec diameter image of a star (assuming a perfectly stable
atmosphere).  [Note that all stars are so distant that they are
<em>point sources</em> in a such a  telescope.]</p>

<li> <em>Seeing</em>: the Earth's atmosphere also refracts light, and
because it is constantly moving, there is always a blurring and
jittering of images in a scope.  Astronomers call this "seeing," and
quantitatively define it to be the <em>diameter</em> of a star image
(in seconds of arc) caused by atmospheric turbulence.  Seeing actually
dominates diffraction in most cases.  Expect typical seeing of 2-4
seconds of arc at the Student Observatory.  Seeing can be measured by
observing a double star of known separation (see writeup for Lab 3).

though a large telescope.  It is a large blob, broken up into smaller
near point-like units.  Click on the image for a

<h3>D. TELESCOPE TYPES</h3></p>


<img src="im/refl-refrac-compare-CM.jpg" align="right">


The three basic types of telescope optics are</p>

<ul>

<li> <i>Refracting:</i> objective is a lens; bends rays.
Galileo's of this type.  McCormick 26-in of this type.  Largest: 40-in
diameter (built 1896).</p>

<li> <i>Reflecting:</i> objective is a mirror; reflects rays.  Invented
by Gregory; improved by Newton.  All large telescopes are reflectors.
Largest 400" (10-m) diameter (built 1993).  </p>

<li> <i>Catadioptric:</i>  combines lenses and mirrors, e.g. to produce a
larger well defined field of view.  Most famous: Schmidt wide field
survey telescopes.  Meade 8-in scopes are of this type.</p>

</ul>



Why are large telescopes all reflectors?

<ul>
<ul>


<li> Lenses produce <em>chromatic aberration</em>: light of different
wavelengths comes to focus at different points.  This was evident in
the drawing of a prism above and is further illustrated below:
</p>

<center>
<img src="im/chroaber-sm.gif">
</center>


<li> Mirrors need be figured only on one side</p>

<li> Mirrors easy to support accurately from behind; lenses require
support at edges, tend to sag.  </p>

<li> Harder to support heavy lens mechanically at top end of tube than 
mirror at bottom end.</p>

<li> Folding action of primary and secondary mirrors (see below) means that
telescope tube is much shorter than in "straight through" refracting design.</p>

<li> <a href="http://astro.uchicago.edu/vtour/whyrefl.html">More discussion</a></p>

things are on the atmos.uiuc site.  Look around when have time:

reflection,</a> and <a href="http://astro.uchicago.edu/vtour/whyrefl.html">why
most research telescopes are reflectors.</a></p>

-->

</ul></ul>


Telescope Designs: great variety!  Here are four common types of
reflector designs:</p>

<center><img src="im/reflect-tel-types.gif" border=2></center>

<p><br></p>

<ul>

Note that in three of the designs shown, a "secondary" mirror at the
top of the telescope tube is used to redirect the light beam.  Although
the secondary does block part of the primary, this has only a small
effect on the net image quality; in particular, it does <em>not</em>
produce a "hole" in the center of the image.  In the Cassegrain design,
a hole is actually made in the primary iteself.  Your 8-in telescopes
have a Cassegrain design.</p>

</ul>


Figuring tolerance:</p>

<ul>
<ul>

<li> To produce a good image, telescope optics must be figured to a
minimum tolerance of about 1/4 of the wavelength.  For optical
telescopes, this is 10<sup>-5</sup> cm.  Small!  Good polishing/test
techniques not developed until 19th century.</p>

<li> Scale comparison:  if a 320" (8-m) diameter telescope mirror were
scaled up to the size of the continental United States, i.e. about
3000 miles diameter, then the maximum size of a ripple allowed in its
polishing would be about 2 inches!  </p>

</ul>
</ul>

Mounting designs:  again, a great variety.  Two primary types:

<ul>

<li> <em>Altitude-Azimuth</em> (Alt/Az) mount:  one vertical axis and
one horizontal axis.  Lowest cost but require computer control for
large scopes since must move in two axes simultaneously to track
stars.</p>

<li> <em>Equatorial</em> mount:  two axes, but polar axis is <u>tilted to parallel
the Earth's rotation axis.</u>  Motion around this one axis then tracks
the stars.  Harder to engineer, easier to operate.  Most telescopes use
equatorial mounts but largest ones are Alt-Az.  Your 8" telescopes are
equatorials.</p>

</ul>


<h3>E. TELESCOPE MILESTONES: (details in <a href="lec7-f02.html">Lecture 7)</a></h3></p>

<ul>

<li> 40-in refractor 1896; largest of this type</p>

<!-- <li> 100-in reflector 1917 </p>
<li> 200-in reflector 1948</p>   -->

<a href="im/keck-mirror-ex.jpg"><img src="im/keck-mirror-ex-sm.jpg" align="right"></a>

<li> Hubble Space
Telescope: 94-in reflector in space (launched 1990); most precise yet
manufactured.</p>

<li> Keck Observatory: Two 400-in (10-m) telescopes consisting
of 36 individual mirror "segments" each (1993,
Hawaii).  See image at right and <a href="keck-diagram.jpg">
diagram.</a> </p>

<li> <a href="im/vlt-1.jpg">Very Large Telescope (VLT):</a> Four 
320-in monolithic mirror telescopes (2000, Chile)</p>

<li> <a href="http://medusa.as.arizona.edu/lbtwww/lbt.html">The Large
Binocular Telescope</a>: twin 8-m telescopes on the same mount and
capable of working together (by <em>interferometry</em>) to produce
super high resolution images.  This is the telescope project UVa
is hoping to join.  </p>

<li> Other EM spectral bands.  Astronomers now exploit wide regions of
the full electromagnetic spectrum.  First instruments outside the
visible range were radio telescopes (1950's).  Now:  radio (e.g.
National Radio Astronomy Observatory, headquarters in
Charlottesville), microwave, infrared, ultraviolet, X-ray, gamma-ray
telescopes.  <a
href="http://www.futureframe.de/astro/instr/index.html">Here is a list
of major telescopes in all EM bands</a></p>
</ul>

<center>

<em>Glass mirror blank for one of the two mirrors <br>
of the Large Binocular Telescope.</em>

<p><br></p>

<h3>F. BINOCULARS</h3></p>

<img src="im/binocular-prisms-JFA-sm.jpg" align="right">

A binocular is simply a pair of two small, co-aligned refracting
telescopes mounted together in such a way that each eye can look
through one of telescopes.</p>

<ul>

<li> Additional optics (prisms---see at right) are used so that the
view is "right side up." </p>

<li> The view for nearby objects is 3-dimensional; special optics may
be used to increase the separation of the objective lenses for better
3-D resolution.  Astronomical objects are so distant that there can be
no 3-D effect.  However, views with binoculars can be especially vivid
because simultaneous use of both eyes produces less strain, and the
optics of binoculars usually allow for easy centering of the eyes on
the emergent beam.  </p>

<li> Binocular optics are usually classified in the form "7 x 35".
Here, the first number is the net <em>magnification</em> of the
binoculars, and the second is the <em>diameter</em> of the primary
lenses in millimeters.  Good types for general astronomical
observations are 7x35 or 8x50.  Binoculars higher than 10 power require
tripods for stability.  The field of view is also often marked on
the binoculars, typically given as the diameter in feet for objects
at a distance of 1000 yards.</p>

<li> Binoculars produce some of the best views of the Moon, rich star
fields, comets, and the Milky Way.

</ul>

<p><br></p>

<h3>G. LAB REPORTS & OBSERVING FORMS</h3></p>

<ul>

<li> Appendices D and E in the ASTR 130 Lab Manual describe how you
are expected to use the <em>standard observing forms</em> to record
observations with binoculars or telescopes and how to write up your
lab reports.  <em>Read these sections carefully.</em></p>

<li> You are expected to have filled out the "prep" part of each
form <u>before</u> going to the Observatory.</p>

<li> To keep forms neater, fill out all sections in pencil.</p>

<li> Blank observing forms and a sample, filled-out form can be found
