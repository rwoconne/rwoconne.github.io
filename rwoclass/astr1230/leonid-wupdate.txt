Subject: Leonid weather etc.,

As you may be noticing the clouds rolling in, I thought I would
send along an update on the cloud cover predictions for the area,
as well as info on moonset and sunrise for tomorrow morning.

Circumstances for the Leonid Meteor Shower

The Astronomy Department will be holding a viewing event for the
ASTR 121/124/130 students at Klockner Stadium from 4:00 a.m. until
twilight.  If you can help out, please let Ed Murphy know.

However, it appears that the cloud cover could be ~ 50% here during the
peak. I list some potentially clearer sites below (between Charlottesville
and Richmond seems to be the best bet and the moment).

PEAK: 

Shower is predicted to be between 4 - 7:30 am, with the peak around
5:30-5:45 am

Note that we won't be able to see the earlier (11pm) peak because the
radiant will be on the other side of the earth.

SUNRISE:

Locally, Twilight begins at 5:27 and sunrise is at 6:59. 

>From past experience, it is still dark enough to take plates at
McCormick until 6:15am. So you can probably still see bright meteors until
6:30 or so (and really bright fireballs until after sunrise?)

Remember, the Moon is essentially full, and sets at 6:27 am

WEATHER:

Predicted % cloud cover from 3-7 am for various nearby locations from
www.accuweather.com

Best weather appears to be to the East, where you can avoid the incoming
clouds for another hour or so. You probably don't need to find the
darkest site, because the moon is full (but downtown Richmond isn't
a good idea, of course).

Halfway to Richmond on I-64 looks like the best bet, in terms of cloud cover.
