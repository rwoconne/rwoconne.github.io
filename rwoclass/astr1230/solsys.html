<h2>A.  INTRODUCTION</h2>

The Solar System consists of the Sun, 8 planets, a number of "dwarf
planets," over 160 satellites, and a thin scattering of
rocky or icy planetoids, comets, dust, and gas.  The Sun is the
dominant object, being 1000 times more massive than the next largest
(Jupiter).  By terrestrial standards, the density of matter in
the Solar System is <b>extremely low</b>, and the planets are
separated by enormous gaps.</p>

Other than the Sun, no solar system object is self-luminous (at
visible wavelengths), and all shine by <b>reflected sunlight</b>.
From the Earth, the second and third-brightest Solar System objects
are the Moon and Venus.  Other than the Sun, the Moon, and some
comets, no Solar System object is resolvable with the naked eye---all
appear instead to be <b>point sources</b> of light.  So, real exploration of
the nature of the planets and interplanetary denizens required the use
of <b>telescopes</b>.</p>

Many interesting features of the Solar System can be observed with the
naked eye, binoculars, and small telescopes, and this lecture is 
aimed at exploring some of these.  </p>


<h2> B. SOLAR SYSTEM MOTIONS</h2>

For most of human history, "astronomy" consisted mainly of naked-eye
studies of the <b>motions</b> of solar system bodies.  We will use
the <a href="http://www.starrynight.com" >Starry Night</a> planetarium
software to simulate the appearance of the sky over many years and
illustrate the <b><em>apparent motions</em></b> of the Sun, Moon, and
planets.  We call these <em>"apparent"</em> motions, because they can
be produced by motions of the <b>Earth</b>, which carries the
observers (us), as well as by the intrinsic motions of the objects
themselves.</p>

<ul>

<li> The stars constitute the backdrop, or <b>"reference frame,"</b>
against which we judge motions of other objects. </p>

<li> The <b>Sun</b> moves about <b>1 degree eastward</b> each day with
respect to the stars and takes 365.25 days to come back to
the same position against the stars.</p>

<ul>

The Sun's annual path through the stars
is always the same and is called the <b><em>ecliptic</em></b>.  The set of
constellations through which the ecliptic passes is called the
<b><em>Zodiac</em></b> (see notes
for <a href="constellations.html#constell">Lecture 1</a>).</p>

The ecliptic path is <b>tilted 23.5 degrees</b> with respect to the
celestial equator, so the Sun's distance from the equator ranges from
0 degrees to 23.5 degrees throughout the year
(illustrated <a href="im/Dec-of-Sun-v-Date.jpg" >here</a>).  Thus, the
Sun's maximum range in altitude from the southern horizon at transit
(i.e. local noon) is <b>47 degrees</b>.  The consequent large change
in the daily solar heat input at a given latitude drives
the <b>"seasons"</b>
(see <a href="im/sunangle-annual-change-Wadsworth.gif" > this
example</a>).</p>

The times of the year when the Sun crosses the equator are
called <b><em>equinoxes</em></b> and times when the Sun is at maximum
distance from the equator are called <b><em>solstices</em></b>.</p>

<ul>  At the equinoxes, the hours of daytime
(when the Sun is above the horizon) and nighttime are <b>12 hours each</b>
for all latitudes on Earth.  The vernal and autumnal equinoxes occur
at about March 21 and September 21, respectively.</p>

At the solstices, we have the longest periods of daytime/nighttime,
and the most extreme dependence of sunlit time on latitude.  The
summer and winter solstices occur at about June 21 and December 21,
respectively.  (The labeling here is based on the seasons in the
northern hemisphere; seasons are, of course, <b>reversed</b> in the southern
hemisphere.)  </p>

</ul>
</ul>

<li> The <b>Moon</b> moves about <b>13 degrees eastward</b> each day with
respect to the stars and takes 27.3 days to come back to the same
position against the stars.  On average, the rise/set times of the
Moon advance by about 50 minutes each day.  The Moon's path is <b>tilted 5
degrees from the ecliptic.</b></p>

<li> There are <b>five</b> easily visible objects in the sky other
than the Sun and Moon which exhibit significant motions with respect
to the stars.  These are the brighter <b>planets</b> (the others were
telescopic discoveries).  Although not as fast as the solar and lunar
motions. their motions are considerably <b>more complex</b>:</p>

<ul>

<li> The general motion of the planets with respect to the stars is
<b>eastward</b> in the sky, measured over a period of weeks to months.</p>

<li> The <b>speed</b> of the motions depends on the planet, decreasing from
rapid to slow in the order: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn.  It
takes Saturn over 29 years to return to the same place in the sky.</p>

<li> Mercury and Venus never move very far from the Sun and appear
to move back and forth in front of/behind it.  The other planets can
appear up to 180<sup>o</sup> from the Sun. </p>

<li> At least once per year, each of the planets halts its eastward
motion and <b>loops backward</b> to the west for a brief period before
starting to move eastward again.  This backward loop is
called <b><em>retrograde motion</em></b>.</p>

<!--
<li> The planets are confined to a relatively <b>narrow band</b> on
the sky that is roughly <b>centered on the ecliptic</b> but not
coincident with it.  The planets are always to be found in
the <b>Zodiacal constellations</b>. </p>
-->

</ul>
</ul>

<p><br></p>

<h2>C. GEOMETRY OF THE EARTH'S ORBIT</h2>

The apparent annual motion of the Sun is caused by the fact that we
are observing it from the Earth, which  is a <b>planet moving in
orbit</b> around the Sun. </p>

<ul>

<li> Earth's orbit is <b>nearly circular</b> (the distance to the Sun
varies only 3.4%), with a mean radius of 150,000,000 km or 93,000,000
miles.  The mean radius of Earth's orbit is defined to be
the <b><em>Astronomical Unit</em> (AU)</b>.</p>

<li> Its orbit lies in a <b>plane</b> (i.e. seen edge-on it would look like
a thin line), and it orbits the Sun in <b>365.25 days (one year)</b>.
Its motion is <b>counterclockwise</b> as seen from above the N pole.</p>

</ul>

vspace=10 ></center>
<hr>
<center><img src="im/zodiac-nov-NS.gif" border=0 alt="Earth Orb Nov" width="55%"
vspace=12></center></p>

<ul>

<li> The stars visible at night are those "opposite" the Sun.  See
figures above (warning! these are <b>grossly distorted</b> in scale!).
The night side of Earth is that opposite the Sun.  So, in May, the
constellation Scorpio will be prominent in the night sky, while in
November, Taurus is prominent whereas Scorpio lies in the
direction of the Sun and therefore is not visible because of the
atmospheric glare.</p>

<li> The Earth's motion around the Sun is <b>counterclockwise</b> in the drawings
above.  This produces an apparent <b>eastward</b> angular displacement
or "motion" of the Sun against the stellar reference frame as seen
from the Earth.</p>

<li> The effects of Earth's motions on the apparent motions of the Moon
and planets are described below.
</p>

Moon seen together<br> from a spacecraft (click for an enlargement).
</em></small></center>


<h2> D. THE MOON</h2>

The Moon is the Earth's only natural satellite.  Although it has only 1/4
the diameter of Earth, it is the largest satellite with respect to its
primary of any in the Solar System except for Pluto's moon Charon.  </p>

<h3>PHASES OF THE MOON</h3>

<ul>

<a href="im/moon-phases-lrg-cidadao.jpg"><img src="im/moon-phases-lrg-cidadao-sm.jpg"
align="right" width=25% hspace=12 vspace=12></a>

<li> Although it seems bright, the Moon's surface is actually very
<b>un</b>reflective (see the image above comparing the Earth and
Moon).  Its reflectivity, or <b><em>"albedo,"</em></b> is only about 10%.
Nonetheless, it is close enough to us to produce a large amount of
light, and it is the second brightest object in the sky after the Sun.
</p>

<li> During the Moon's monthly circuit, its bright area exhibits
drastic changes in apparent <b>shape</b>, from crescent to round and
back.  The shapes are called <b><em>phases</em></b> of the Moon. The
phases repeat after a period of 29.5 days.  This is longer than the
time it takes the Moon to circle the Earth once against the stars
because of the continual motion of the Earth around the Sun (explained
<a href=" https://rwoconne.github.io/rwoclass/astr1210/lunar-motions.html">here</a>). A
montage of photographs of the lunar phases during a month is shown at
the right.  Click for an enlargement. </p>

<li> Lunar phases had considerable practical consequences in
pre-industrial societies that had to rely on the Moon for nighttime
illumination.  They still have dominant effects on astronomical
observations because of the tremendous <b>brightening of the night sky</b>
produced by scattered light near full Moon (called <b>"bright time"</b>
by astronomers).  </p>

<li> The phases of the Moon are a <b>shadow effect</b> originating
from the facts that it is a <b>sphere, half-illuminated from the direction of
the Sun</b> which we view from 
<a href="im/moon-phases-NS.gif">different perspectives</a> as it moves
in its orbit around Earth. </p>

<li> The lunar phases as well as two other important phenomena
associated with the Moon -- <b><em>polar precession</em></b>
and <b><em>eclipses</em></b> -- are explained in detail on
<a href="https://rwoconne.github.io/rwoclass/astr1210/lunar-motions.html">
this supplementary page from ASTR 1210</a>.</p>

<h3>SURFACE OF THE MOON</h3>

The Moon is the only "planetary" surface that can be examined
in detail through a small telescope, and it is a fascinating
study.  Galileo's small telescopes (1609) first revealed the Moon's
remarkable terrain.  </p>

<img src="im/moon-drawing-1.jpg" align="right" width="30%">

<ul>

<li> The Moon has <b>no atmosphere</b>, so there is no obscuration of its
surface features.  More importantly, these are <b>not subject to
weathering</b>.  The Moon's surface has been shaped over 4.5 billion years
by the relentless infall of asteroids, meteoroids, and smaller
interplanetary debris.  Almost all of its geology is related to
these <b>impacts</b>.  </p>

<li> The numerous <b>craters</b> (up to 150 mi diameter) are the best
indicators of impacts.  Unlike on the Earth, almost none of these are
related to volcanic activity.  In fact, the Moon's interior has been
too cool to sustain surface volcanic activity for over a billion years.
The <b>mountains</b> on the Moon (casting shadows in the drawing at
right), which range up to 25,000 feet, are also impact effects, not
the products of plate tectonics as on Earth.  Similar scars from
impacts cover the other solid surfaces in the solar system (Earth and
a few outer planet satellites excepted). </p>

<li>The rounded, dark grey areas (part of the "man in the Moon" face)
are called <b><em>maria</em></b> ("seas"), even though we now know
they contain no water.  They are the products of ancient massive
impacts by asteroidal bodies which were later filled in by dark lava.
They have relatively smooth surfaces except for a few craters.  These
regions are younger than the lighter grey, rougher <b>"highland"</b>
regions.  Ages can be estimated by the crater density (fewer craters
implies younger regions).</p>

<h2>E. PLANETARY ORBITS</h2>

<ul>

<li> The planets accumulated from the flattened band of solid debris
that surrounded the Sun as it formed.  Their orbits consequently lie
in almost, but not quite, the <b>same plane</b> in 3-dimensional
plane.  </p>

<li> The picture above shows an oblique view
of the planetary orbits to scale (though the planet sizes shown are
not to scale).  <a href="im/orbital-inclinations-FB.gif" >Here is an
edge-on plot</a> of the orbits showing the near-coincidence of the
orbital planes.</p>

<li> The plane of the Earth's orbit defines the ecliptic path we see
on the sky.  Because most planetary orbits are only slightly inclined
with respect to Earth's, they will always be observed in
a <b>relatively narrow band in the sky, centered on the ecliptic</b>.
They therefore move through the <b>Zodiacal constellations</b>.  </p>

<li> The apparent motions of the planets in the sky are determined by
orbital geometry and are a <b>combination</b> of the intrinsic motion of the
planets <b>and</b> the motion of the Earth.
</p>

<center><img src="im/plan-configs-FB.gif" width="90%" hspace=12></center></p>

 
<li> See the illustration above.  All planets move in the <b>same
direction</b> around the Sun (counterclockwise as seen from above the
Earth's North Pole).  Planets <b>nearer</b> the Sun move <b>faster</b>
in their orbits and have shorter orbital periods. (Historically, this
was an important clue to the nature of gravity as deduced by Newton.)
</p>

<ul>

Right panel: As viewed from the Earth, the two planets inside the
Earth's orbit (so-called <b><em>"inferior"</em></b> planets) can
<b>never appear at large angles from the Sun.</b>  Mercury and Venus always
stay within 27<sup>o</sup> and 48<sup>o</sup>, respectively, of the
Sun.  </p>


Left panel: The planets outside Earth's orbit
(<b><em>"superior"</em></b> planets), starting with Mars, can be seen
at up to 180<sup>o</sup> from the Sun.  When they are exactly at that
point they transit at midnight and are said to be
at <b><em>"opposition"</em></b> with respect to the Sun.  As the
figure shows, planets at opposition are also <b>nearest</b> the Earth
then and are therefore brightest.  </p>

These angular relationships are called the <a
href="im/planet-configurations.gif" > <em>planetary
configurations</em></a>. </p>

</ul>

<li> The planetarium simulation in the image below shows the
concentration of the planetary orbits to the ecliptic, as seen from
Earth. </p>

<center><small><em>

of planetary motions as seen from Earth.</em></small></center></p>


<li> The "retrograde loops" in the trajectories in the image above are
caused <b>not by the planet's motion</b> but by the <b>Earth's annual
motion</b> around the Sun.  
<a href="im/retrograde-anim-UTK.gif" >Here</a> is an animation showing
how retrograde motion is produced by the change in perspective for
Earthbound observers as the Earth moves in its orbit.  The retrograde
motion for a superior planet is greatest at opposition.

<h2>F.  OBSERVING THE PLANETS</h2>

<font color="blue"><b>Three Kinds of Planets:</b></font> What a mess!
In the summer of 2006 astronomers held a debate over the meaning of
the term "planet"---specifically whether or not Pluto and the several
other newly discovered distant objects that are similar to Pluto
should be placed in a separate category.  In the end, the
International Astronomical Union voted to create a new category
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet" >"dwarf
planet"</a> for these latter objects.  All this was handled very
clumsily; and it generated needless controversy, especially among the
many who were fond of planet Pluto, since it was demoted. </p>

Including this new category, there are <b>three</b> types of planets:
<b><em>terrestrial planets</em>, <em>Jovian planets</em>, and <em>dwarf
planets</em></b>:

<ul> <li> <b>Terrestrial Planets</b> (archetype Earth; Mercury, Venus, Mars):
These are relatively small planets with solid, <b>rocky</b> bodies and
<b>thin</b> or absent atmospheres.  The rocky material is made mainly of
silicon, oxygen, iron and similar elements.  Even though Venus'
atmosphere is 100 times thicker than Earth's, this still counts as
"thin."</p>

<li> <b>Jovian Planets</b> (archetype Jupiter; Saturn, Uranus, Neptune):
Also called "giant" planets, these are primarily made of <b>hydrogen and
helium</b>, with a thin smattering of heavier elements.  They are much
larger than Earth.  They have <b>enormous atmospheres</b>
with denser but slushy interiors. They may have rocky or
icy cores, similar in size to the Earth, but there is no well defined
boundary between their atmospheres and their interiors.</p>

<li> <b>Dwarf Planets</b> (archetypes Ceres, Pluto; dozens of others):
any other object in orbit around the Sun and massive enough for
self-gravity to make it roughly spherical.  Ceres is in the asteroid
belt, but no other asteroids qualify as dwarf planets.  The other
dwarfs are all in
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt">Kuiper
Belt</a>, in the outer solar system.  Pluto-like dwarfs are primarily
made of <b>ices</b>, with additional rocky material; Ceres contains a
larger fraction of rocky material.  There are probably thousands of
Pluto-like dwarfs in the outer solar system. </p>

</ul>

All the non-dwarf planets except Uranus and Neptune are easily visible
to the naked eye.  With your 8-in telescopes, you can also observe
Uranus (5.5 mag) and Neptune (7.8 mag).  Pluto is 14.9 mag, and is
visible only in larger telescopes.  Ceres is a relatively easy target
for your telescopes (even though it is smaller than Pluto and other
ice dwarfs, it is much nearer).   Venus and Mercury can be
observed in daylight.</p>

Click <a href="im/planets-telappearance-RASC.jpg" >
here</a> for sketches of the appearance of the planets in small
telescopes. </p>


<font color="blue"><b>MERCURY</b></font>:  Hard to observe only because
it is always near the Sun and never very far from the horizon at
night.  Surface features are too subtle to be detected in a small
telescope.  Like Venus, shows phases.</p>

<b><font color="blue">VENUS</font></b>: Dazzling white in the sky.
Can be astonishingly bright and is the source of more "UFO"
(Unidentified Flying Object) reports than any other astronomical
object.</p>

<ul>

<a href="im/phases-of-venus-2004.jpg">
<img src="im/phases-of-venus-2004.jpg" align="right" width="30%"
vspace=10  hspace=10></a>

<li> UFO Reality check:  Watch for 5 minutes; is
the "UFO" stationary with respect to the stars?  Is it within about
40<sup>o</sup> of the western or eastern horizon?  Is it in a Zodiacal
constellation?  If yes, then it's probably Venus.</p>

<li>Venus is the planet nearest Earth and has the orbital period most
closely matching Earth's.  Consequently, it can "linger" near the
horizon before sunrise or after sunset over several month's time,
undergoing a complex set of motions.  See
our <em><a href="http://www.starrynight.com" > Starry Night</a></em>
demonstration.  </p>

<li>  The <b>carbon dioxide</b> which makes up the bulk of Venus' atmosphere
would be transparent, but unfortunately it is filled with
<b>dense clouds</b> (made of sulfuric acid droplets!), which shroud
the surface.  However, Venus does show pronounced <b><em>phases</em></b>,
like the Moon's (see illustration at right) as it orbits the Sun.  The
geometry is shown <a href="im/venus-phases-huffman.gif" >here</a>.
Neither Venus nor Mercury have satellites.</p>

</ul>

 <font color="blue"><b>MARS</b></font>: Undergoes large changes in
distance, and consequently apparent size & brightness, from Earth.
Brightest at opposition (once every 2.1 years); but because of its
relatively elliptical orbit, its distance at opposition can vary by a
factor of two (see diagram).</p>

Click <a href="https://physics.unm.edu/Courses/Rand/applets/retrograde.html">
here</a> for a Java animation of the relative motion of Earth and

2003, Mars was closer to Earth than at any time since 57,617 BC
(34,646,418 miles distant). The opposition in July 2018 was also very
favorable, and the one in October 2020 will be only slightly less so.
Click on the chart at the right for a diagram of upcoming
oppositions. </p>


<li> Mars' atmosphere is primarily <b>carbon dioxide</b> and is
<b>transparent</b>.  Its surface color is conspicuously red-pink
(hence its association with the God of War), caused by <b>iron oxide
compounds = rust</b> on its surface.  Mars has been explored with ever
increasing resolution by Earthbound telescopes, orbiting spacecraft,
and lander spacecraft.  Use the links below to reach the large and
beautiful set of spacecraft images of Mars.  </p>

width="30%" hspace=10 ></a>

<li> Mars is distant enough that even at opposition telescopes on
Earth yield relatively poor resolution (especially since they must
contend with seeing), and this led to a long controversy over whether
or not there was evidence for "canals" or other artificial features on
its surface.  (More details given <a
href="https://rwoconne.github.io/rwoclass/astr1210/guide16.html"
> here</a>.)  </p>

<li> However, under good conditions with an 8-in telescope, you can
easily see the <b>polar caps</b> (some water but mainly frozen
CO<sub>2</sub>) and <a href="im/mars-drawings-2012-McKim.jpg"
><b>extensive markings</b></a> on the surface.  Monitoring these
features over several months will reveal slow changes, including
growth or shrinking of the caps with the seasons and effects of dust
storms on the surface, especially in the Martian spring.  The image at
the right was taken by amateur astronomer Antonio Cidadao with a 10-in
telescope.  </p>

<li> Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, with orbital periods
of about 8 and 30 hours, respectively.  Unlike Earth's Moon, they did
not form in orbit around their parent; instead, they are captured
asteroids.   With apparent magnitudes of 12-13 even during an
opposition of Mars, they are at the limit of what could be detected
in an 8-inch telescope. </p>

</ul>


<font color="blue"><b>JUPITER</b></font>: A very bright, yellowish
object, normally the fourth brightest in the sky (after the Sun, Moon,
and Venus).  Its celestial motion is much slower than any of the planets
already discussed.</p>

<ul>

<li> Unlike the four terrestrial planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and
Neptune are <b><em>gas giants</em></b> and probably have no sharp boundary between
interior and atmosphere.  Through your telescopes, what you will see
is the <b>top of their cloud layers</b>.</p>

<li> The <b>banded structures</b> in Jupiter's atmosphere, called
"belts" (dark) and "zones" (light), are multiple cloud layers shaped
by powerful winds moving parallel to the equator.  An 8-in telescope
can reveal beautiful details.  The
<b><em>red spot</em></b> is an oval-shaped, perpetual cyclone in the
atmosphere, about 3 times the diameter of Earth (seen near the 
limb in the picture at right).  Because Jupiter rotates in only
10 hours, you get to see a variety of features in just a few hours.</p>

<li> Jupiter has an extensive <b>satellite system,</b> consisting of
79 known moons, mostly small and not visible in small telescopes.  The
four largest of these (<b>Io, Europa, Ganymeade, Callisto</b>) were
discovered by Galileo and are known as
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_moons"
><b> <em>Galilean satellites</em></b></a>.  They are easy to see in a
small telescope, and their relatively rapid orbital motions around
Jupiter can be readily tracked.
NASA's <a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/">Voyager </a>
and <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo">Galileo</a> missions
revealed astonishing differences in surface constitution among the
four.  Europa hides warm interior oceans beneath a smooth, icy
exterior; this is one of the most promising sites in the solar system
to explore for extraterrestrial life.  In small telescopes,
unfortunately, no surface details are apparent.</p>

</ul>

 <font color="blue"><b>SATURN</b></font>: Famous as the <b>ringed planet</b>,
though all four gas giants actually have rings. </p>

<ul>

<li> Its cloud layers are deeper within its atmosphere than are Jupiter's,
so it typically shows only faint surface banding and subtle
features. </p>

<li> The rings are <a href="im/sat-ring-particles.jpg" ><b> orbiting
chunks of rock and ice</b></a> and lie exactly in the equatorial plane
of the planet.  The bright rings extend 85000 miles from the center of
the planet.  They are spectacular in small scopes, and a fair amount
of substructure, especially the dark <b>"Cassini Division"</b> seen in
the <a href="#sat">image at the top of this page</a>, is visible.
Spacecraft images reveal <a href="im/satrings-false-lg.gif" > hundreds
of ringlets</a>.  A beautiful mosaic of the rings from the Cassini
orbiter is available
at <a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06175" > this
web site</a>.
 </p>

<li> Six of Saturn's 62 satellites would be visible in an 8-in telescope.
<b>Titan</b>, Saturn's largest moon, is the only moon to have its own
atmosphere.  It was one of the principal targets for
the <a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.cfm" >
Cassini-Huygens Mission</a>, which made observations from orbit around
Saturn for 13 years.  The Huygens probe made a successful soft landing
on Titan in January 2005.  Images of Titan and Saturn are continually
updated on the Cassini site.
</p>

</ul>


<font color="blue"><b>URANUS</b> and <b>NEPTUNE</b></font>: All of the
above planets were known to naked eye astronomers.  The others are
products of the telescopic age (Uranus was discovered in 1781).
Uranus and Neptune are distant enough that they show only small
blue-green disks in an 8-in telescope, without further details being
visible (they have very low contrast atmospheres even seen close up).
You will need a finding chart to locate them.  Their satellites are
too faint for detection in the 8-in scopes.</p>

<h2>G.  INTERPLANETARY MATTER</h2>

Although only a trace constituent of the Solar System, the material
between the planets provides a number of interesting, even
spectacular, observational phenomena.  These are all
"leftovers"---debris from the formation of the solar system.  The
larger chunks (comets,
asteroids) <a href="https://rwoconne.github.io/rwoclass/astr1210/guide22.html">pose
significant dangers to the Earth.</a></p>

<!-- unresponsive 1/2021: http://janus.astro.umd.edu/orbits/outerSS.html -->

<font color="blue"><b>COMETS</b></font>: are large chunks
of <b>ice</b> which start to evaporate when they get within several
Astronomical Units of the Sun (one AU = the distance between Sun and
Earth), producing a gaseous
<b><em>coma</em></b> and sometimes a <b><em>tail</em></b>.  The Solar
System contains billions of comet nuclei, but most are beyond the
orbit of Neptune.  Most have <a href="im/halley-orb-2.gif">very elongated
orbits</a> and reach small distances from the Sun only infrequently.
Some, however, are gravitationally deflected by Jupiter into orbits
with shorter periods (< 100 years); these are called "periodic"
comets.  Most are faint.</p>

<ul>

<li>  <b>Halley's</b> is an exception as a bright periodic comet (75
years), with observed visits to the inner solar system traced back 
to at least 240 BC.
The most spectacular comets, like
<b><em>Hale-Bopp</em></b> (1997; at right), are usually first-time
visitors to the inner Solar System.
Click <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/comet" >here</a> for more
information on Hale-Bopp.</p>

<li> There are always several
faint comets available to observe in the sky; but bright ones are
rare: once a decade or so.  If you are interested
in <b>name-recognition immortality</b>, consider searching for new
comets, because they are the only astronomical objects traditionally
named for their discoverers. </p>

</ul>

<font color="blue"><b>METEORS</b></font>: are the incandescent trails
of tiny pieces of rocky or icy debris burning up at high altitudes in
the Earth's atmosphere.  Up to about 10 per hour can be seen on dark
nights at any time of the year.  Most will be 2-4 magnitude, but
"fireballs" can be much brighter.  Debris left behind by comets along
their orbits can produce concentrated <b><em>meteor showers</em></b>
with much higher rates, up to 1000's of meteors per hour in rare
instances.  The Earth passes through these debris streams at regular
times each year.  The best showers are the Perseids (Aug 12-13),
Orionids (Oct 21-22), Leonids (Nov 17-18), and the Geminids (Dec
14-15).  The Leonids have been known to
produce <a href="im/leonids-1833-village-lg.jpg"> spectacular
showers</a>, but none are expected in the near future.</p>

<font color="blue"><b>ASTEROIDS</b></font>: Asteroids, traditionally
called "minor planets," are large rocky or metallic chunks ranging
from less than a few meters to hundreds of kilometers in diameter.
They move in their own orbits around the Sun.
<b>Ceres</b>, 1000 km in diameter, was the first discovered (1801).
It is estimated there are about 750,000 asteroids larger than 1 km in
diameter, and over 500,000 have now had their orbits determined(!)  Most
orbits are concentrated between Mars and Jupiter, but many cross the
Earth's orbit.  </p>

<img src="im/rd_star.gif"> Here</a> is
a snapshot plot of the location of asteroids in the inner Solar
System.</p>

<li> Many asteroids are detectable with an 8-in telescope, but you
need updated coordinates and finding charts.  Their signature is a
fairly rapid motion with respect to the background stars. 
The <a href="https://www.astroleague.org/al/obsclubs/asteroid/astrcobs.html">Astronomical League</a> provides advice on observing asteroids.
