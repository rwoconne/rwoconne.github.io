	      added.  3/5; 3/8; F02: 9/3/2002; 10/24; 10/25; 10/27;
	      10/28; 11/4; 10/31/2004 -- dropped as separate Lec8 for
	      schedule reasons & made an optional subpage of Lec7;
	      3/27/2005; 10/17/2006; 10/22/2008: had been titled
	      "7.1--AstronInstrum" use segments on imaging/surveys and
	      make new lec7-f08.html; delete segment on spectroscopy;
	      delete former lecture 7 material on "Modern Observational
	      Astronomy" and make that an optional subpage; elaborate
	      on detectors, color imaging, etc; 10/25; 10/26; 11/1;

	      (formerly dormant) extracted and made a separate
	      "7.2-Spectroscopy.html" page; 5/1; 9/14/2015: new
              domain; 5/25/2019: convert to ASTR 1210 format;

<h2>A. INTRODUCTION</h2>

Spectroscopy is the study of how the EM energy released by a cosmic
source is <b>distributed over wavelength</b>.  This distribution is
known as a <b>spectral energy distribution</b> or more simply the
<b><em>"spectrum"</em></b> or the  source. </p>

Typical astronomical spectrographs use <b>prisms</b> or <b>diffraction
gratings</b> to <b><em>disperse</em></b> light according to its wavelength.  The drawing
below illustrates a prism spectrograph:</p>

<h2>B.  THE POWER OF SPECTROSCOPY</h2>

How is this useful?</p>  

<ul>

<li> We already saw in <a href="stellar.html"> Lecture 5</a> that the
overall shape and peak wavelength of the EM spectrum of a star are
related to its <b>temperature.</b> </p>

<li> This is true of any <b>self-luminous, dense</b> object: its EM
spectrum is smooth or <b>continuous</b> and changes only slowly with
wavelength.  You can think of the atoms and electrons in such an
object as interacting so strongly that the individual signatures of
each type of atom are blended away. </p>

<li> On the other hand, in a dilute or <b>thin</b> gas---the
atmosphere of the Sun, for example---the atoms do not interact
strongly, and if there are enough atoms of a given type, they will
impress their <b>individual signatures</b> on the emergent spectrum.  The
internal electronic structure of each type of atom consists of
<b>discrete energy states,</b> and these states are <b>unique</b>
to that type.</p>

<li> In the spectrum of a dilute gas, electrons moving between the
states produce sharp features called <b><em>"spectral lines</em></b>."
They are seen either in
<a name="emissline"><b><em>emission</em></b></a> (if the gas is
observed in isolation) or
<b><em>absorption</em></b> (if it is observed against a continuous
source).  The 3 general kinds of spectra are summarized in the
illustration below: </p>

<center><img src="im/frak-emspec-types-ex.jpg" alt="EmSp Types" width="70%"
vspace=10 >
</center><br>

<li> Because each type of atom produces a unique spectrum, the
<b>chemical composition</b> of cosmic objects can be deduced from
their spectra even though they may be millions of light years away.</p>

<ul>

The figure below shows optical-band spectra of 13 kinds of stars.  The
dark lines are produced by atoms of hydrogen, calcium, magnesium,
iron, sodium, titanium, and other elements.  Quantitative analysis of
such spectra allows us to deduce the detailed chemical makeup of the
Sun and other stars.</p>

For example, the element <b><em>helium</em></b> (the
second lightest after hydrogen) was discovered in the spectrum of the
Sun <b>before</b> it was studied in an Earth-bound laboratory; several
absorption features of helium (labeled "He") are identified in the
figure. </p>

The figure shows how the prominent absorption lines change with the
temperature of the star.  The labeling at the left hand side gives the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_type#Spectral_types"><b>spectral
type</b></a> of each spectrum.  From top to bottom the type listing runs
from high (30,000<sup>o</sup>) to low (3,500<sup>o</sup>)
temperatures.   The incidence of strong absorption lines increases in
cooler stars.  Click for an enlargement. </p>

<li> In addition, spectra also contain information on the velocity,
pressure, density, temperature, ionization state, turbulence, magnetic field
strength, and other physical characteristics of cosmic objects.
Spectroscopy is therefore an exceedingly powerful tool.  It is the
<b>source of much of the astrophysical information</b> we have about the
universe.</p>

<li> Perhaps the most famous application of astronomical spectroscopy
is the use of the <a
href="http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/rwoclass/astr1210/121supps2-3.html">"Doppler
shift"</a> in the spectra of distant galaxies to demonstrate that the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift">universe is expanding</a>.  
</p>

<li> In modern professional observatories, spectrographs are
frequently the largest, most sophisticated, and costly instruments
used with telescopes.  For a representative sampling of recent
state-of-the-art spectrographs,
see <a href="http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/rwoclass/astr511/lec10-f03.html">this
lecture</a> from my ASTR 5110 course.</p>
