<h2>A. INTRODUCTION</h2>

Astronomers have developed a wide array of ingenious instruments for
attaching to telescopes in order to make measurements of the sky.
Historically, the human eye was employed exclusively as the
<em>detector</em>.  Modern instruments, however, almost exclusively
use other kinds of detectors.  The kind of instruments used depend on
the particular band of the EM spectrum for which they are designed.
Entirely different technologies are used in the radio region, for
example, than in the optical band.  Here, we discuss the two most
powerful types of optical band equipment: imagers (cameras) and
spectrographs.</p>

<h2>B. IMAGING</h2>


<u>PHOTOGRAPHY</u></p>

<ul>

<li> Although the human eye is a marvelously sensitive and adaptable
instrument, even poor quality film easily outperforms
it for astronomy.  The first astronomical photographs were made late
in the 19th century.  Photography offered revolutionary
capabilities to astronomers: </p>

<img src="im/hubble-at-100in.gif" alt="HubbPhot" border=2 align="right"
vspace=4 hspace=4>

<ul>

(i) First, it provided <u>permanent records</u> of
observations.</p>

(ii)  Second, it permitted <u>very long exposure times</u>
and hence the detection of faint objects far beyond the capability of
the human eye.  Under dark conditions, the eye integrates a light
signal for a few tenths of a second.  Film can integrate the signal
for <u>many hours</u> (even up to a week), providing a detectability thousands of
times fainter than the eye.</p>

(iii)  A third important, if less basic,
property is that film can be made sensitive to a <u>much wider range
of EM wavelengths</u> than is the eye. </p>

</ul>

As a consequence, the impact of photography on astronomy was
profound.</p>

<li> All optical band detectors, including film, rely on the
<a href="im/photoelec-effect-UColPhys2000-lg.jpg" target=show>
<u>photoelectric effect</u></a>.  This is the ejection of an electron
from a photosensitive surface when struck by a photon of EM energy.
In the case of film, the electrons are stored by crystals in an
<em>emulsion</em> until the chemical reactions during development
cause them to precipitate grains of silver, which form the permanent
image. </p>

<li> Film was the detector of choice in astronomy from around 1900 to
1985.  [The picture above right shows Edwin Hubble guiding the camera
on the Mt. Wilson 100" telescope ca. 1930.]  However, it had
limitations with which astronomers had long struggled.  First, it was
relatively insensitive in that it responded to <u>only about 1%</u> of the
incident light.  (We would say that film has a <em>quantum
efficiency</em> of only 1%.)  Second, it was very difficult to
<u>calibrate</u> photographic signals quantitatively in terms of the amount
of incident EM flux.  </p>

</ul>

<p><br></p>

<u>ELECTRONIC IMAGING</u></p>

<img src="im/CCD.gif" alt="CCD" border=2 align="right" vspace=4 hspace=4>

<ul>

<li>Starting in the 1920's, astronomers began using various types of
<u>electronic detectors</u> to supplement film.  World War II greatly
accelerated these technologies, especially in the form of the <a
href="im/photomultiplier.jpg" target=show><em>photomultiplier tube</em></a> which could
amplify a single photon into a large burst of electrons.  </p>

<li> These devices were highly sensitive and very useful in many
applcations.  But none of them were easily converted into large format,
two-dimensional detectors until <u><em>charge-coupled devices (CCD's)</em></u>
were introduced in the 1970's.  A CCD is a light-sensitive silicon
wafer with built-in microcircuitry (see picture at right).  During
an exposure, it traps the released electrons in small voltage wells.
After the exposure, the collected electrons are rigidly shifted across
the CCD (so the image isn't smeared), amplified, and stored in a
computer memory.  The cartoon above illustrates the electron shifting
technique.</p>


<li> CCD's are very powerful devices and are the basis of most modern
digital and video cameras.  For astronomers they have the following key
advantages: </p>

<ul>

(i) They are <a href="im/detector-QEs-FB.gif" target=show><u>highly
sensitive</u></a>, with quantum efficiencies over 80%.  This means
they can detect <a href="im/photo_vs_ccd-FB.gif" target=show>much fainter
sources</a> in a given exposure time than can film.</p>

(ii) They are <u>highly linear</u>, meaning
that their response is directly proportional to the EM flux deposited;</p>

(iii) They immediately convert a scene into a <u>digitized computer
image</u>, which can then be further analyzed by <u>image
processing</u> software.  CCD's have now virtually replaced film in
professional astronomy. </p>

</ul>

<li> One
complication for the low light levels important to astronomers is the
presence of <em>dark current</em> in CCD's (a residual signal in the
absence of incident light), which requires that they be operated at
low temperatures of about -100<sup>o</sup>C.  </p>

<ul>
The requirement for low temperatures while making long exposures is
the reason that mass market digital cameras do not work well
for most astronomical applications.</p>
</ul>

<li> The largest CCD is still much smaller than typical photographic
"plates."  To cover large fields, astronomers have built <a
href="im/SDSS-CCDcam.gif" target=show> <em>mosaic CCD cameras</em></a> containing
many individual CCD chips.  Below is an extract from a 3-color image
of the Rosette Nebula taken at the Kitt Peak National Observatory with
a mosaic CCD camera containing 8450x8450 pixels.  The image below was derived
from 3 individual images with filters centered on <a href="#emissline">emission lines</a> of
hydrogen (coded red), sulfur (blue), and oxygen (green). 
[Color separation
images of astronomical objects are much easier to construct using
CCD's than was the case with film because of their linearity and
immediate conversion to digital format.]  Click for a

<h2>C.  SKY SURVEYS</h2>


<a href="im/hubble-at-48in.jpg" target=show><img src="im/hubble-at-48in-small.jpg"
alt="48in" border=2 align="right" vspace=4 hspace=4 ></a>

One of the most important tasks for astronomical imagers is simply to
<u>map</u> the sky---i.e.  to find out what's there.  Systematic,
all-sky surveys began over 200 years ago with, for example, the
<em>New General Catalog (NGC)</em> of 7000 diffuse objects (nebulae
and galaxies) by Herschel and his sons (pre-photographic).  The
photographic <em>Henry Draper Catalog</em> of 300,000 stars (ca. 1900)
was immensely valuable in clarifying stellar evolution.</p>

With the development of large telescopes, astronomers realized
they needed <u>very sensitive, all-sky imaging surveys,</u> made with
specialized telescopes.  The modern prototype was the <a
href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~wws/poss2.html" target=show> <em>Palomar
Observatory Sky Survey (POSS)</em>,</a> completed in the 1950's with a
specialized wide-field photographic telescope, the 
<a href="im/48-in-schmidt-Porter-draw.jpg" target=show>48-in Schmidt</a>.  This took
matched photographs with blue and red filters on large plates with
fields 6 degrees on a side.  It reached about 20th magnitude.  At
right is a picture of Edwin Hubble guiding the 48-in Schmidt.  </p>

Several follow-up surveys, also with large format photographic plates,
have been made or are in progress.  The whole sky has now been mapped
to about 20th magnitude.  All of this material is being converted to
digital format for computerized retrieval.</p>

Emphasis is now shifting
to all-electronic surveys, which instantly produce digital
output.  All-sky maps have also been made to varioius depths in a
number of other EM bands, from radio to gamma ray.  Useful Web

2.5 microns wavelength.  Mike Skrutskie (UVa) was Principal Investigator
for the survey.

<h2>D.  SPECTROSCOPY</h2>

Spectroscopy is the study of the <u>distribution with wavelength</u>
(or the  <em>"spectrum"</em>) of the EM energy released by a cosmic source. 
Typical astronomical spectrographs use <u>prisms</u> or <u>diffraction
gratings</u> to <em>disperse</em> light according to its wavelength.  The drawing
below illustrates a prism spectrograph:</p>

<center><a href="im/prismrefrac-JFA.jpg" target=show><img
src="im/prismrefrac-JFA-sm.jpg" alt="PrismSpec" vspace=4></a></center>

<p><br></p>

How is this useful?</p>  

<ul>

<li> We already saw in <a href="lec5-f06.html" target=show>
Lecture 5</a> that the shape and peak wavelength of the EM spectrum of
a star are related to its <u>temperature.</u> </p>

<li> This is true of any <u>self-luminous, dense</u> object: its EM
spectrum is smooth or <u>continuous</u> and changes only slowly with
wavelength.  You can think of the atoms and electrons in such an
object as interacting so strongly that the individual signatures of
each type of atom are blended away. </p>

<li> On the other hand, in a dilute or <u>thin</u> gas---the
atmosphere of the Sun, for example---the atoms do not interact
strongly, and if there are enough atoms of a given type, they will
impress their individual signatures on the emergent spectrum.  The
internal electronic structure of each type of atom consists of
<u>discrete energy states,</u> and these states are <u>unique</u>
to that type.</p>

<li>   In the spectrum of a dilute gas, the states appear as
sharp features called "spectral lines."  They are seen either in
<a name="emissline"><em>emission</em></a> (if the gas is observed in isolation) or
<em>absorption</em> (if it is observed against a continuous source).
The 3 general kinds of spectra are summarized in the illustration
below:  </p>

<center><img src="im/frak-emspec-types-ex.jpg" alt="EmSp Types" border=2>
</center><br>

<li> Because each type of atom produces a unique spectrum, the
<u>chemical composition</u> of cosmic objects can be deduced from
their spectra even though they may be millions of light years away.
The figure below shows the (wrapped) optical-band spectrum of the Sun
extending from near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths.  The
dark lines are produced by atoms of hydrogen, calcium, magnesium,
iron, titanium, and other elements.   Quantitative analysis of such
spectra tells us the detailed chemical makeup of the Sun and other
stars.  For example, the element <em>helium</em> (the second lightest
after hydrogen) was discovered in the spectrum of the Sun
<u>before</u> it was studied in an Earth-bound laboratory.</p>

<center> <small><b><em>The solar spectrum.  Click on the
figure for an enlargement of the spectrum of the red giant star
Arcturus.  </em></b></small></center>

<p><br></p>

<li> In addition, spectra also contain information on the velocity,
pressure, density, temperature, ionization state, magnetic field
strength, and other physical characteristics of cosmic objects.
Spectroscopy is therefore an exceedingly powerful tool.  It is the
<u>source of much of the astrophysical information</u> we have about the
universe.</p>
