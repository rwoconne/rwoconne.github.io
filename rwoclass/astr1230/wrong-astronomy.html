Here is a list of <b>ten common misconceptions</b>
about the sky that you should do your best to forget:</font></p>

<p><br></p>

<ul><ul>

<font  color="blue" size="+1"><b>

   <li> Polaris is the brightest star </p>

   <li> Polaris is located due North and will always be there</p>

   <li>  You can see nearly all the stars there are</p>

   <li>  The stars aren't there in the daytime </p>

   <li>  The Sun and Moon are stationary with respect to the stars</p>

   <li>  A constellation is a physical group of stars all near each other in space</p>

   <li>  The brightest constellations are along the Zodiac</p>

   <li> The shape of a constellation has physical or metaphysical significance</p>

   <li> The patterns of the constellations are unchanging</p>

   <li>  Meteors are falling stars</p>

</b></font>

</ul></ul>

<p><br></p>

The point here is not that many people are ignorant
about what really goes on in the sky.  Instead, it's that to start
making sense out of nature, you have to <b>carefully study</b> it.  Some
of these misconceptions can be dispelled with just a little thoughtful
examination of the sky.</p>

You will quickly learn that there is a big difference between a casual
look and a patient, careful, systematic inspection.  Our "intuition"
about nature is shaped by our everday experience of things on only a
human scale and is often wrong.  </p>

We will explain why these beliefs are incorrect in the course of the next
few lectures.</p>
