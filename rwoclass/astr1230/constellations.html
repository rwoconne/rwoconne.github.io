<!-- <b>  -->

Astronomy is primarily an <b>observational science</b>.  It is driven
more by new observational discoveries than by interpretive insights.
Few important astronomical discoveries were predicted, and many were
actually <b>accidental</b>.  The human imagination has never been a match
for the universe.</p>

Astronomical discovery began with the simplest of observations: people
looking at the night sky and trying to understand what they were
seeing -- sometimes in awe and wonder, sometimes in fear of the
unknown powers at work in the heavens.  </p>

In the past, most people were well acquainted with the basic features
of the night sky.  We are unfamiliar with the sky in modern times
mainly because of the advent
of <a href="im/USA-light-pollution-1950-2025.jpg"><b>artificial
lighting</b></a>, which makes it difficult to see the night sky in
urban areas (and also unnecessary to know the sky as a
pathfinder).  </p>

This lecture introduces you to the basic features of the night sky which
are visible to the unaided eye and prepares you for the Constellation
Laboratory.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2> A. NAKED-EYE ASTRONOMY</h2>

<b>"Naked eye"</b> observations (i.e. without optical aid from lenses or
mirrors) were the <b>only kind</b> possible for most of human
history!  Telescopes were not invented until 1608 AD.</p>

Nonetheless, great accomplishments were possible without telescopes,
e.g.: </p>

<ul><ul>

<li>Determination of the size and shape of the Earth and Moon; origin
of eclipses (Greeks,
500 BC - 200 AD)</p>

<li>Discovery of Earth's motion around the Sun (Copernicus, 1513)</p>

<li>Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion (1609, based on Tycho's
observations), which led to Newton's Laws of Motion and the
modern scientific revolution </p>

</ul></ul>

<a href="human-eye.html"><b>The human eye</b></a> is a remarkably capable
astronomical instrument.  Follow this link for background information
on its function and the important observing considerations of
<b>dark adaptation</b> and <b>averted vision</b>.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2>B.  MOTIVATIONS TO OBSERVE THE SKY</h2>

The concerted study of the sky started long before modern science
arose ca. 1500 AD.  How long?  We don't really know---probably at
least 8000 years before.  Almost every human society, pre-literate or
literate, whose culture we have been able to sample in detail shows
some awareness of celestial phenomena --- if not in the form of
written records then in other ways, such as the alignment of buildings
or other structures to cardinal directions.
</p>

<!-- In prehistoric times, astronomy consisted of <b>simple observations
that any interested person could make</b>.  In fact, up to the
nineteenth century most people were well acquainted with the basic
features of the night sky and were able to use them for orientation
and <b>pathfinders</b> for nighttime travel.  We are unfamiliar with
the sky in modern times mainly because of the advent of
<a href="im/USA-light-pollution-1950-2025.jpg"><b>artificial
lighting</b></a>, which makes it difficult to see the night sky in
urban areas.  We no longer need to use the sky as a pathfinder
either.</p>  

Systematic observations of the sky, ranging from crude to
sophisticated, were made by many historical cultures, pre-literate and
literate.
</p>  -->


Initial motivations: </p>

<ul>

  <li>  <b>Curiosity</b>---the most enduring motivation for trying to understand nature
             </p>

  <li>  <b>Aesthetics</b> </p>

  <li>  <b>Fear/Religious Belief</b>:</p>

<ul>

<a href="im/Aten_disk_rays-v2.jpg"><img align="right" src="im/Aten_disk_rays-v2.jpg" width="35%" vspace=10 hspace=10></a>

<li> One example: 
<font color="blue"> <em>Astrology</em></font>.  This is
the idea that the motions of the Sun, Moon, and planets against the
stellar background can be used to predict the future and can influence
human personalities.  It derived from the ancient belief that these
objects are <b>living gods</b>, who betray their intentions by their
movements. This was obviously a powerful motivation for observing the
sky.  In the carving shown at the right the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaton
(ca. 1350 BC) and his family are communing with the Sun god Aten, the
source of Akhenaton's power.  </p>

As our scientific understanding grew, astrology lost its interest for
most people.  We realized that the Sun, Moon, and planets are
<b>inanimate objects</b>, moving in highly regular and predictable
patterns in response to the well understood force of gravity.
Constellations and the Zodiac were recognized to lack physical
significance (see below).  New planetary bodies were discovered that
astrologers had somehow failed to detect.  Statistical tests showed no
correlation between "sun signs" and personality or personal history.
There is no evidence, theoretical or empirical, for astrology.
Astrology lingers only as a form of pseudo-science and popular
entertainment.  But it, and related ideas, did play an important
historical role in encouraging the systematic observations of the sky
that ultimately led to the scientific interpretation of the solar
system.  </p>

</ul>
</ul>

Study of the sky quickly reveals the existence of <b>regular cycles in
time</b> of the Sun, Moon, & planets.  These became the central
concern of early astronomers because of their <b>immense practical
value</b> for:  </p>

<ul>

       <li>    <b>Navigation</b>: on land & sea</p>

       <li>    <b>Time Keeping</b> </p>

       <li>    <b>Calendar Keeping</b>:  tracking the date & seasons</p>
                            
       For some early societies (e.g. the Polynesians, who sailed
       thousands of miles across the uncharted ocean), these could
       be <b>critical survival technologies.</b></p>

</ul>

<h2>C. NAKED EYE MEASUREMENTS</h2>

Only a <b>few kinds of measurements</b> are possible with the naked eye:  </p>

1. <font color="blue"><b>Angular Separations</b></font> 


<table width=100%>
<tr>
<td width=70%>
<font size="+1">
<ul> Studying the geometry of the sky by measuring <b>angles</b> is the most basic
    form of astronomy. Apart from time tracking, this was the only
    accurate quantitative measurement possible before the
    advent of modern instrumentation.</p>


    <a href="im/crossstaff.jpg">Measured angles</a> can be
    all-celestial ("sky", e.g. star-to-star) or celestial-terrestrial.
    They can be between different celestial objects, between a
    celestial object and a reference point on Earth, or across a
    celestial object.</p>

    Modern Units: <b>Degrees, minutes, seconds of arc</b></p>

    <ul>

    Full circle = 360 degrees of arc;<br> 
    1 degree = 60 minutes of arc;<br> 
    1 arcmin = 60 seconds of arc</p>

    Don't confuse these angular units with units of <b>time</b>!  Always use
    the "arc" terminology for clarity.</p>

 </ul>

<tr>
<td width=70%>
<!--  TEXT HERE; can use ul indents, etc, as appropriate  -->
<!--    Use as many lines as needed   -->
<ul>

<font size="+1">
   Examples:</p>

   <ul>
    Angles subtended by a <b><em>quarter</em></b> at distance D:<br>
     [Note: the symbol ~ means "approximately"]</p>
   <ul> 
      <li> 1 degree @ D = 56 in<br>
      <li> 1 arcmin @ D = 270 feet<br>
      <li> 1 arcsec @ D = 3 miles</p>

   </ul>

   The bowl of the <a href="im/dippers_JLodriguss.jpg">"Big

</td></tr>
</font>
</table>

<ul>

   The human eye has 1-2 arcmin <b><em>resolution</em></b>---i.e. it
   cannot distinguish two stars separated by less than 1-2 arcmin.</p>

 <ul>
   <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/hst">The Hubble Space Telescope</a>, for
     comparison, has
     better than 0.1 arcsec resolution; i.e. it can resolve a quarter at a
     distance of 30 miles</p>
 </ul>

  <a href="im/fingerangles.jpg"> <img src="im/fingerangles-sm.jpg"
  alt="Hand-y Angles" align="right" width="28%" hspace=10 vspace=10></a>

   <b>"Hand-y" measuring scale</b> (see illustration):</p>

    <ul>

    1 degree = width of index finger @ arm's length<br>
    10 degrees = width of closed fist @ arm's length<br>
    20 degrees = distance thumb to little finger on outstretched
       hand @ arm's length</p>

  <!--     Note implicit use of  simple <i>geometry</i></p>
    <ul> 
      E.g.: for thin isosceles triangles, length of base is
          proportional to apex angle times side </p>
    </ul>
   -->

    Example: the angular diameter of the Sun or Moon is about 0.5
    degree.  You can block out either with your index finger held @
    arm's length.  Try it! </p>

    The "Hand-y" scale is useful to remember as you orient yourself
    to the night sky and compare objects you see there to star charts.</p>

   </ul></ul>
   <p><br></p>


 2. <font color="blue"><b>Brightnesses</b></font></p>

   <ul> 

   Astronomers quote star brightnesses on
   the <b><em>magnitude</em></b> scale.  This scale has roots in
   star catalogs made by the ancient Greeks (ca. 150 BC).  It was based
   originally on simply <b>ranking</b> the stars by their apparent
   brightness as seen with the unaided eye.  Without instruments, this
   kind of ranking is about the best observers can do.</p>

   Today, the scale has been quantified in terms of the light power
   deposited by an individual star per unit area at the Earth and tied
   to telescopic measurements made with electronic detectors.  </p>

   The magnitude scale is logarithmic, open-ended, and runs
   <b>"backwards"</b> (like a sports ranking scale):
   <b>Brighter</b> objects have  <b>smaller</b> magnitudes.  </p>

   The brightest stars are about 0 magnitude; the faintest visible to the
   naked eye are about 5-6 magnitude.  The brighter planets and most
   familiar stars have magnitudes in the range -4 to +2.
   There are only 11 stars brighter than magnitude 1 visible from
   Charlottesville but there are 1630 stars brighter than magnitude 5.  </p>

  <ul> 

   The faintest objects yet detected (by the Hubble Space Telescope)
   are 30th magnitude, or over 1 billion times fainter than visible to
   eye.</p>

  </ul>

   The human eye can make only rough measures of magnitudes; accuracy
   was only possible after the invention of photography and
   electronics.  Magnitudes are discussed further in the notes on <a
   href="stellar.html#mags">Stellar Astronomy</a>.</p>

  </ul>

3. <font color="blue"><b>Colors, Shapes</b></font> (in some cases)</p>

4. <font color="blue"><b>Time</b></font></p>

<ul>

Even crude measures of angles and brightnesses, if made
systematically over days, months, or years, immediately reveal the
presence of repeating <b>time cycles</b> in the motions of 
the Sun, Moon, and planets.  As mentioned above, these were important
for their practical value.  But they also showed there was <b>order</b> in 
the universe, even if the origin of the motions was mysterious.  They
provided strong intellectual stimulus for investigations of the structure of
the universe. </p>

</ul>
</ul>

<h2>D. EASILY VISIBLE PHENOMENA</h2>

<ul>

<li><font color="blue"><b>STARS</b></font>:  form the backdrop or
<b><em>"reference frame"</em></b> against which other objects' motions are
measured.  About 2000-5000 are visible to the eye (depending on
eyesight) over the whole sky.  About 1000 are visible on a dark, clear
night from a given location.  The brighter stars form <b>conspicuous
patterns</b> which seem unchanging (to the eye).</p>

<ul>

<li> Motion: stars <b>move continuously in lockstep</b> across sky
from East to West.  Patterns come back to the same location in the sky
after <b>slightly less than 24 hours</b>.  Star locations in the sky
at a given time of night
<b>change systematically</b> throughout the year.  </p>

<li> Can you see all the stars that exist?  NO!  There are <b>vast</b>
    numbers of stars that are <b>invisible</b> to the eye.  With our
    8-in telescopes, we can see stars about 800 times fainter than the
    naked eye limit---and there are 5 million of these over the whole
    sky.  But our star system (the Milky Way Galaxy) contains about
    100 billion stars, and there are billions of galaxies!  </p>

</ul>

<li><font color="blue"><b>SUN</b></font>: The most obvious astronomical
object (and most important for us!).  Steady brightness.  Has a <b>slow
eastward motion</b> relative to the stars (about 1<sup>o</sup> per
day; we have to infer the Sun's position since the stars are invisible
in daylight).  Returns to the same place against the star background in
<b>one year (365.25 days)</b>.  </p> 

<li><font color="blue"><b>MOON</b></font>:  Very bright, but much fainter than
the Sun.  More <b>rapid eastward motion</b> relative to the stars
(about 13<sup>o</sup> per day).  </p>

<ul>

 Shows a <b>drastic change</b> in brightness and <em><b>phase</b></em>
 (bright part as a fraction of a full circle) during each cycle, from
 totally dark to fully illuminated.  Takes 29.5 days to return to the
 same phase (e.g. "full"). This is the cycle we have formalized in our
 calendar as the <b>month</b> ("moonth").  There are 12 lunar cycles
 per year.  </p>

Note: Moonlight was of <b>enormous practical value</b> before electrical
lighting was invented, so the phases of the Moon were closely followed
in earlier times.</p>

</ul>

<li> <font color="blue"><b>PLANETS</b></font>: Less obvious.  5
bright, starlike objects; these have a <b>slow, complex</b>
predominantly eastward motion relative to the stars.  In order of
speed of motions (fastest to slowest): Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter,
Saturn.  Two of these (Mercury, Venus) are always found relatively
near the Sun; others can be up to 180 degrees away. Although all the
planets have perceptible disks in telescopes, the naked eye cannot
discern these.</p>

</ul>

Other, less conspicuous, features visible to the eye (with the modern
interpretation):</p>

<ul><ul>

<li> <font color="blue"><b>METEORS</b></font>: sudden streaks of light
in sky; typical rate 5-10 per hour.  These are small pieces of ice or
rock, burning up in Earth's atmosphere.  Often called, but are
definitely not, "falling stars."  Concentrations of debris (from
comets) produce "meteor showers,"
e.g. <a href="im/leonids-1833-village-lg.jpg">the Leonids</a>, lasting
up to several days. </p>

<a href="im/m13-JWare.jpg"><img src="im/m13-JWare-ex.jpg"
 align="right"  width="25%" hspace= 10 vspace=10></a>

<li> <font color="blue"><b>COMETS</b></font>: occasional (once every
few years) flamelike objects moving slowly through the sky over
several weeks.  Comets are large (~ 1 km) chunks of ice, usually on
very elongated orbits, that begin to release gas and dust when they
become heated by the Sun on entering the inner Solar System.
E.g.  <a href="im/HB-308B.jpg">Hale-Bopp (1997)</a>, which is visible
in the night sky panorama at the top of this page.  </p>

<li><font color="blue"><b>STAR CLUSTERS</b></font>: compact groups of
stars, all formed together.  E.g. the Pleiades and Hyades.  About a
dozen are visible to the naked eye, but scores are visible in small
telescopes.  The largest are the "globular clusters"
(e.g.  <a href="im/m13-JWare.jpg"> M13</a>, shown at the right),
containing up to 100,000 stars.  Since all stars in a given cluster
have the same age, clusters became the keys to
understanding <a href="stellar.html">stellar evolution</a>.</p>

<li> <font color="blue"><b>DIFFUSE NEBULAE</b></font>: clouds of
interstellar gas lit up by hot stars.  A handful are visible without
telescopes.  E.g. <a href="im/orionneb-NS.gif">the Great Nebula in
Orion.</a> These mark the birthplaces of young stars.  Smaller
"planetary nebulae" mark the death of old stars.</p>

<li> <font color="blue"><b>MILKY WAY</b></font>: appears as a faint,
diffuse band of light arcing across the sky.  It is the combined light
of millions of distant stars in the plane of our
own <a href="galactic.html">Galaxy</a> (a massive, flattened star
system), seen edge-on.  </p>

<li> <font color="blue"><b>EXTERNAL GALAXIES</b></font>: other large star
systems like our Galaxy.   4 are visible to the eye, 2 of these are in
the northern hemisphere.  E.g.  <a href
="im/m31-color-GGreaney.jpg">the Andromeda Galaxy</a>---the most
distant object you can see without a telescope.  It is 2 million light
years from us, meaning that the light you see from it tonight started
its journey 2 million years ago.  For more discussion of
this <em>lookback effect</em>, see
<a
href="https://rwoconne.github.io/rwoclass/astr1210/guide02.html">
this ASTR 1210 page</a>.  Hundreds of galaxies are detectable in
small telescopes.  </p>

</ul></ul>


<font color="blue"><b>Interference: sky brightness</b></font>:  your view of
the sky is strongly affected by <b>background sky light</b>, both
natural and man-made.  During the day, <b>sunlight</b> scattered by molecules
in the Earth's atmosphere produces the "blue sky" that completely
obscures almost all other cosmic objects from our eyesight (though the
Moon is often easy to see in daylight, and you can detect Venus if you
know where to look).  Likewise, near full moon, only the brightest
objects are visible in the night sky because of atmospheric scattering
of <b>moonlight</b>.  <b>City lights</b> create enough local <a
href="im/usa_lights.small.gif">"light pollution"</a> to
rival or exceed the effects of the full moon.</p>

<p><br><p>


<h2>E. ORIENTATION IN THE NIGHT SKY </h2>

<a name="celsphere">

It is important, but difficult, to try to visualize your situation
when you look into the sky at night.  You are standing on a
<b>spherical, spinning, moving planet</b>.  What you can see in the
sky is determined by the Earth's orientation and position in its orbit
around the Sun.  Your view of the sky is always made in your <a
href="im/local-ref-frame-AWL.jpg"> <b><em>"local reference
frame"</em></b></a>.</p>

<center>
<a href="im/loc-refsys-NS.gif"><img src="im/loc-refsys-NS.gif"
alt="Local Reference System" width="40%" hspace=10 vspace=10
></a></center>

<ul>

The local <b><em>"horizon plane"</em></b> is the (ideal, imaginary) plane
"tangent" to (just touching) the Earth at your location; you can see
objects above the plane but not below.  The horizon plane sweeps
across the sky as Earth spins; it determines the <b>rising and setting</b> of objects.
The horizon plane is different at each location on Earth.</p>

<!-- <img src="im/celsphere-edm.gif" align="right" alt="CelSphere" border=1> -->

The <a href="im/celestial-sphere-CM.jpg"><b><em>Celestial
Sphere</em> (CS)</b></a> is a geometric construct used to
vizualize the positions of astronomical objects. </p>

<ul> 

The celestial sphere is an <b>imaginary hollow sphere</b> centered on Earth.
It is shown shaded in the illustration above.  Directions to key
orienting positions and to each astronomical object are imagined to be
marked on the surface of sphere.</p>

Exactly one-half of the celestial sphere (one hemisphere) is always
above your local horizon.</p>

</ul>

The <b><em>zenith</em></b> is the point directly overhead on the CS.  It
is equidistant from all points on the horizon. </p>

The <b><em>north and south celestial poles</em></b> are the points on the CS
where the projection of Earth's rotation axis pierces the CS.  These
are fixed points.  </p>

The <b><em>celestial equator</em></b> is the outward projection of Earth's equator to
the CS.  It is a "great circle" (i.e. a circle drawn on the celestial sphere
with its center coincident with the center of the sphere).</p>

Your <b><em>meridian</em></b> is the great circle on the CS that passes
through <b>both celestial poles AND your zenith</b>.  It runs from due
North to due South, splitting the celestial hemisphere in half.
The meridian is not marked on the drawing above; instead, see <a
href="im/local-ref-frame-AWL.jpg">this figure</a>.  </p>

</ul>

<center><a href="im/loc-refsys-motions.gif">
<img src="im/loc-refsys-motions.gif" alt="Sky Motion" width="42%"
hspace=10 vspace=15></a></center>


The <b><em>diurnal</em></b> motion:  The daily <b>spin</b> of the Earth on
its axis produces an apparent <b>counter-rotation</b> of the CS and its
"attached" stars across your local sky.  One complete rotation around
its axis with respect to the stars takes 23h56m (note--not quite 24
hours).  <!-- People on the Earth's equator are being spun around at
about 1000 mph. --> The Earth rotates <b>eastward</b>, so the sky
appears to rotate continuously <b>westward</b>.  Objects "rise" in the
east or "set" in the west when they cross your local horizon plane.
See the figure above. 
 </p> 

<ul>


An astronomical object is said to <b><em>transit</em></b> when it crosses the
meridian.  At this time it is farthest from the horizon and
<b>highest in the sky</b>.  </p> 


<!-- 
Stars rise in the east, move across your meridian, and set in the west.
See the figure above. (More on motions in <a
href="lec3-f06.html">Lecture 3</a>).</p>
-->

</ul>

<h2>F.  NIGHT SKY SIMULATIONS </h2>

In class, we will use the <a href="http://www.starrynight.com">"Starry
Night" planetarium software</a> to simulate the appearance and motions
of the night sky.  This is an excellent app that is very useful to
purchase if you're more serious about observing.

<h2> G. CONSTELLATIONS</h2>


<a href="im/orion-chart.gif"><img align="right"
src="im/orion-chart-sm.gif" width="25%" hspace=10
vspace=10></a>

<!-- The human brain is wired for this kind of pattern recognition. -->

The stars are not uniformly distributed on the sky.  Many of the
brighter stars form conspicuous <b>patterns</b>.  To the eye, the
patterns seem unchanging: the stars appear <b>"fixed"</b> relative to
one another.  Historically, the patterns were very useful for
orientation, navigation, and determining the time of night or the date
and so were given <b>names</b>.  </p>

<ul>
 (The human brain is wired for this kind of pattern
 recognition: people who could recognize the tiger lurking in the
 forest shadows survived better than those who could not.) 
</ul>

Each named pattern is called a <b><em>constellation</em></b>.
Constellations are associated with mythological figures, animals, instruments,
and other features from the natural, human, or religious worlds.
An example of the stick-figure pattern associated with "Orion the
hunter" is shown at
right. </p>


<h3>History</h3>

<ul>

<a href="im/mesopot-bound-stone-2.jpg"><img align="right"
src="im/mesopot-bound-stone-sm.jpg" width="25%" hspace=10 vspace=10></a>

<li> It was natural for people to seek deeper meaning in these remote,
silent, but majestic figures at the limit of the visible world.  So,
the constellations often were given important mythological or
religious associations.  These were, however, strongly
culture-dependent, and the same patterns can have very different
interpretations in different cultures. </p>

<li> Some associations we recognize today are very ancient, going back
to around 2000 BC (e.g. Leo the lion, Scorpio the scorpion.  See the
carved stone at right; click for enlargement.) Some are new
(Microscopium).  Few resemble their namesake closely.
 </p>

<li> <a href="im/Gr-vase-constell.jpg">The Greeks (500 BC - 200
AD)</a> added rich mythological associations and fanciful stories
(e.g. for Taurus, Perseus, Andromeda).  Aratus' epic poem
<a href="https://www.theoi.com/Text/AratusPhaenomena.html"><em>The
Phaenomena</em></a> (ca. 270 BC) describes the constellations as a
memory aid to navigators.  Ptolemy's <em>Almagest</em> (135 AD) listed
positions of 1022 stars in 48 constellations.  His catalogue was used
for the next 1400 years(!) </p>

<!-- ADD: Farnese Globe link to next  -->

<li> The Romans inherited the Greek myths.  The names of most
constellations are Latin.</p>

<li> Arab astronomers were active 700-1600 AD, and many modern star
names have Arabic roots: Algol ("the demon star"), Aldebaran ("the
follower"), Betelgeuse ("armpit of the Central One"). </p>

<li> 1600+: new constellations were added to fill in blanks, mostly
in the Southern Hemisphere.  E.g. Telescopium, Pyxis (compass).  Elaborate &
beautiful printed atlases of classical associations appear (an
illustration of the north polar constellations from a 1660 atlas by
Cellerius is shown below).</p>

<li> In 1930 the International Astronomical Union established formal
boundaries for 88 constellations that cover the entire celestial
sphere.  74 are visible from Charlottesville.  Click <a
href="im/orionb.boundaries.jpg">here</a> for an
illustration of the boundaries for Orion.  </p>

</ul>

<h3>Significance of the constellations:</h3>

<ol>

<li> Constellations have <b>no physical significance</b>.  The
associations are arbitrary & man-made.  Constellations are not natural
groups of stars.  The fainter stars in a constellation 
don't participate in the pattern
(as illustrated <a href="im/orion-chart-IAU.gif">here</a>
in the case of the Orion region.)  Stars in a given constellation lie near
the same line of sight from Earth but are <b>not necessarily close
to one another in space</b>.  (Click <a
href="im/orion-sky-projection-exl.jpg">here</a> for an
illustration in the case of Orion.)  Shapes are specific to the Earth's
location in 3-D space (a fact not recognized when ancient astrological
systems, which attached significance to the shapes, were
developed).</p>

<ul>
Click <a href="im/orion-color-mosaic-RAndreo-90.jpg">here</a> to see a
modern, deep telescopic image of Orion that reveals the many beautiful
fainter features lying in this direction but mostly invisible to
the naked eye.  </p>
</ul>


<li> <b>The stars are all moving</b> with respect to one another, even
though the changes would not be apparent to the eye except over
thousands of years.  Therefore, <b>constellation patterns are
transitory.</b> The changing appearance of the "Big Dipper" (part of
Ursa Major) now and 100,000 years from now is shown below.  <a
href="im/proper_motion_big_dipper.gif">Here</a> is an
animation of the motion of the Big Dipper stars over 200,000 years.
</p>

<!-- pm of typical UMa bright star is 0.1"/yr  -->

<center><a href="im/dipper-motion-10000-sm.jpg"><img src="im/dipper-motion-10000-sm.jpg" width="35%" vspace=15 hspace=10></a></center>


<li>Modern astronomers use constellations only as a convenient
"address" to roughly locate objects in the sky. </p>

</ol>

<h3>Terminology:</h3>

<ol>

<li> The <a href="im/zodiac-NS.gif"><b><em>zodiac</em></b></a>
("circle of animals") is the set of constellations through which the
Sun passes in the course of a year.  The Sun's path is called the
<b><em>ecliptic</em></b>, and the Moon and bright planets also stay near this
path. Given the modern boundaries of the constellations, there are 13
ecliptic constellations.  But in classical astronomy (and current-day
astrology) there are only 12---one for each month.  The ecliptic, and
hence zodiac, is determined by the accidental orientation of the <b>plane
of Earth's orbit</b>.  Most zodiacal constellations are faint and
uninteresting (e.g. Libra, Capricorn, Aquarius).  </p>


<li> <b>Constellation names:</b> Latin, often translated from Greek</p>

<li> <b>Star names:</b> the brighter stars have "common" names derived
from a mix of Greek, Latin, & Arabic.  Most stars brighter than 20th
magnitude have catalog numbers (most recently recorded by
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(spacecraft)">Gaia
space observatory</a>).  Fainter stars---i.e. <b>most</b> stars---are
largely uncataloged.  </p>

<ul>

Bright stars have many synonyms since they appear in many catalogs</p>

<ul>

E.g:   the star at the mouth of Canis
Major (the large dog); brightest star in the sky</p> 

<ul>

    <li>  Sirius ("the scorched one" in Greek) --- common name<br>
    <li>  = Alpha Canis Majoris --- Bayer listing<br>
    <li>  = 9 Canis Majoris --- Flamsteed listing<br>
    <li>  = HD 48915  --- Henry Draper Catalog listing<br>
    <li>  = BD -16 1591 --- Bonner Durchmusterung listing<br>
    <li>  = SAO 151881 --- Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) listing<br>
    <li>  = 0645-16  --- Right Ascension/Declination coordinate listing</p>
     

</ul>
</ul>

Bayer's <em>Uranometria</em> (1603)
assigned <a href="im/greek_alphabet.gif"><b>Greek letters:</b></a>
alpha, beta, gamma, etc.  to stars, usually in order of brightness, in
each constellation; about 1300 stars have Bayer designations.  But
because of errors (or, in some cases, actual changes in brightness),
the order is not necessarily correct today.  E.g. Alpha Ori
(Betelgeuse) is fainter than Beta Ori (Rigel). </p>

Flamsteed (1712): <b>numbered stars</b> in each constellation in "Right
Ascension" (west to east) order: e.g.  61 Cygni, 40 Eri, etc.; used
today for brighter stars without Bayer designations.</p>

SAO catalog numbers are needed to locate stars in the 
database stored in your Celestron telescope computers.</p>

Modern digital catalogs contain up to one billion stars (but this is still
only a small fraction of all stars in our galaxy).  Most list objects
in Right Ascension order. </p>

</ul>

<li> There are also many catalogues of <b>non-stellar objects</b>,
such as nebulae, star clusters, and galaxies.  The three you will most
frequently encounter are the New General Catalogue ("NGC"), the <a
href="http://messier.seds.org">Messier Catalogue</a>
("M"), and the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldwell_catalogue">The Caldwell
Catalog of Deep-Sky Objects</a> (an updated version of the Messier
Catalogue).
</p>

</ul>
</ol>

<a name="orient"><h2>H. COMPLETING LABORATORY 1 AND THE CONSTELLATION QUIZ</h2>

<ul>  


<li> Read the Lab 1 chapter in the Manual.</p>

<li> The Lab will be given on the <b>first two usable nights on or
after the night of this lecture. </b>  
You can come to either night.  Check the Observatory status via the
recorded message (924-7238) after 6:30 PM.</p>

<li>  You will work in groups.  Each group will be assigned a set of
stars and constellations to learn from the required list in the
Lab 1 description.  After a group has mastered these, they
will teach the other groups. </p>

<li> Advice on learning constellations: </p>

<ul>

<li> Review and disregard the misconceptions about the sky that are
listed in <a href="wrong-astronomy.html">Ten Things to Forget
About Astronomy</a>.</p>

<li> Because not all objects on the Constellation Quiz are identified by
name on your Sky Wheel, consult the
following sky charts, which contain labeled objects for the Quiz:
</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="const_quiz_spring.pdf">Spring semester skychart</a><br>

<li><a href="skychart_jan.jpg">Spring semester skychart</a><br>
<li><a href="skychart_sep.jpg">Fall semester skychart</a></p>
</ul>
--->

</ul>

<li><b>Find the "North Star," Polaris</b> (in Ursa Minor = "the Little
Dipper").  Polaris is near to, but not exactly coincident with, the
North Celestial Pole.  It is <b>not</b> a very bright star.  Easiest
method is to use the two "pointers" at the end of the bowl of Ursa
Major (the Big Dipper).  See the sketch below.  Alternatively, if Ursa
Major is low in the sky, you can use the stars in Cassiopeia as
pointers.  <a href="im/pointers-UMa-Cass-Polaris.gif">See this
illustration</a>.  </p>

<li> Then <b>orient yourself N/S/E/W.</b>  When you face Polaris, your right
arm is toward the East and your left is toward the West.</p>

<li> Find your <b>zenith</b> and your <b>meridian</b>.   </p>

<li> Orient your <b>sky wheel</b> to match the time of night by
<b>aligning the date and time tickmarks.</b>  (Note: time marked is always
<b>Standard</b>---not Daylight Savings--- time.)  Using the wheel and pattern
recognition, "hop" to other bright stars and groups.  Use brighter,
more conspicuous constellations to locate others.  Practice locating
all the constellations, stars, and other features on the Manual list
for this semester. </p>

<li> <b>Difficulties</b> with using charts:</p>

<ul>

  <li>  <b>The scale of the real sky is very different</b> from a chart<br>

  <li> <b>Brightnesses can't be represented well</b> on paper. Relative
      brightnesses of real stars look very different.<br>

  <li> <b>Poor sky transparency, city lights, or moonlight reduce visibility.</b></p>

</ul>

<li> Practice using <b><em>averted vision</em></b> to find fainter
objects: rather than looking directly at the target, stare about 15
degrees away, but concentrate on the target's location. (This puts the
image on a more sensitive part of your retina.)  You can find more
about the capabilities of the naked
eye <a href="human-eye.html">here</a>.</p>

</ul>

<li> After you have had time to learn the constellations, you will be
examined individually by a TA on your knowledge of the sky.  You will
be expected to be able to identify 20 constellations, bright stars, or
other features of the sky.  </p>
