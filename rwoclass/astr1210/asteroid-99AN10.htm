              <p align="LEFT">Following is a file of information on the near-Earth 
                asteroid called 1999 AN10, discovered by the MIT-USAF LINEAR telescope 
                on 13 January 1999. Dynamicists Andrea Milani, Steven Chesley, 
                and Giovanni Valsecchi carried out an analysis of its orbit, which 
                involves resonances with the Earth and permits close encounters 
                with the Earth over the next several hundred years. </p>
              <p align="LEFT">On 26 March 1999, these authors requested several 
                colleagues to look at their manuscript and check the general validity 
                of their calculations of the orbit of this asteroid. They wrote, 
                in part: "The subject of this paper is such that we consider essential 
                that its content be reviewed by the most qualified experts before 
                it is made public. This paper has been submitted to a scientific 
                journal. We do not want the content of this paper to reach the 
                non-scientific media until it has been carefully reviewed. . . 
                . Note that it would be unwise to hurry with a public announcement 
                for three good reasons. First, we have established that there 
                is no risk of impact until 2039, and even then the probability 
                of impact is well below the background level. Second, the asteroid 
                is now almost impossible to observe, and even if it were observed 
                new astrometric positions taken now would not contribute significantly 
                to the improvement of the orbit. Third, the issues raised by this 
                case are indeed very complex. . . Please note that we had no obligation 
                to submit our paper to this highly unusual refereeing procedure: 
                we felt this as a moral obligation. We are asking you to carefully 
                examine our paper looking for every possible fault in our arguments, 
                but with respect for our work and for our scientific priority. 
                . . . We intend to make the paper available on our web server 
                on April 6 unless some of you can point out to some reason not 
                to. Thus you should send us your comments, criticisms, and whatever 
                queries you have, as soon as possible. In particular if there 
                is some fundamental flaw in our arguments we would like to know 
                before making any information publicly available." </p>
              <p align="LEFT">Several of the colleagues they addressed responded 
                with detailed technical commentary, but none disagreed with the 
                basic conclusion that this asteroid poses no significant threat 
                of Earth impact for at least the next 40 years. Thus, Milani and 
                his co-authors posted the manuscript on their website early on 
                6 April, as they had indicated they would do. About a week later 
                the manuscript was circulated to a larger group of experts at 
                the request of the International Astronomical Union. These informal 
                technical referees also agreed with the conclusions concerning 
                the exceedingly low probability of an impact with Earth. </p>
              <p align="LEFT">Subsequently to this Web posting, the case of asteroid 
                1999 AN10 became widely known and has stimulated considerable

              <p align="LEFT"> Abstract: The Earth passes very close to the orbit 
                of the asteroid 1999 AN10 twice per year, but whether or not this 
                asteroid can have a close approach depends upon the timing of 
                its passage across the ecliptic plane. The uncertainty of this 
                timing grows with time: by 2027 it is +/- 12 days. Among the possible 
                orbital solutions there are some that undergo a close approach 
                in August 2027, but no impact is possible. However, the period 
                of the asteroid may be perturbed in such a way that it returns 
                to an approach to the Earth at either of the possible encounter 
                points. We have developed a theory which successfully predicts 
                the 25 possible such returns up to 2040. We have also identified 
                6 more close approaches resulting from the cascade of successive 
                returns. None of these encounters can result in an impact, except 
                one in August 2039: the probability that the true asteroid actually 
                follows a collision course for that date is less than the probability 
                of being hit by an undiscovered asteroid within any given day. 
                Because of this extremely chaotic behaviour there is no way to 
                predict all possible approaches for more than a few decades after 
                any close encounter, but the orbit will remain dangerously close 
                to the orbit of the Earth for about 600 years</p>

                UNION </p>
              <p align="LEFT"><br>
                From the IAU website The International Astronomical Union Working 
                Group on Near Earth Objects (WG NEO) provides, as a service to 
                the international astronomical community, voluntary expert review 
                of reports that might have implications for possible future Earth 
                impacts. The review process was first used in April 1999 in the 
                case of newly discovered mile-wide asteroid 1999 AN10. NEOs with 
                orbits that permit close encounters or even collisions with the 
                Earth are of considerable interest to scientists who compute asteroid 
                orbits. As a consequence of their frequent close encounters with 
                the Earth or other planets, it is difficult to predict their orbits 
                with high precision for more than a century or so into the future. 
                One such object is 1999 AN10, discovered by the MIT-USAF LINEAR 
                search program on 13 January 1999. A detailed analysis of the 
                orbit of 1999 AN10 was completed by researchers Andrea Milani, 
                Steven R. Chesley and Giovanni B. Valsecchi in March 1999. Their 
                paper, which has been submitted for publication in a technical 
                journal, includes an examination of the potential risk of 1999 
                AN10 hitting the Earth in the next several decades. They conclude 
                that, while there is some uncertainty in the exact orbit of this 
                NEO following its next close planetary encounter in August 2027, 
                the chances of its actually hitting the Earth in the next 40 years 
                are minuscule -- the authors estimate that the chance of impact 
                is of order 1 in a billion (1 in a thousand million), which they 
                indicate is 10,000 times less than the chance that the Earth will 
                be struck by some as-yet-undiscovered similar-sized NEO in any 
                one year. The IAU's Working Group on Near-Earth Objects has formed 
                an ad hoc committee, with widely international expert membership, 
                whose members are available to review predictions of impact hazards 
                if so requested. This committee functions similarly to the referees 
                of most technical journal articles in reviewing the predictions, 
                and it also keeps the appropriate IAU officials completely informed 
                about any such predictions. The technical paper by Milani and 
                colleagues has been subject to such informal review during the 
                first two weeks of April 1999, and it is the consensus of the 
                reviewers that the work is accurate and of the highest scientific 
                quality. The IAU reviewers also note that the chances of impact 
                by NEO 1999 AN10 during the time-span considered in this paper 
                are negligible compared to the risks we run continuously of being 
                struck by one of man similar size NEOs that have not yet been 
                discovered. Like asteroid 1997 XF11, which was widely discussed 
                in the press in March 1998, this asteroid does not pose any significant 
                danger to the Earth on the time scale of the next several decades. 
                Astronomers will continue to search for new NEOs and to track 
                the orbits of those already discovered, especially when, like 
                1999 AN10, their orbits bring them close to the Earth. But this 
                object, as demonstrated in the technical paper by Milani and his 
                colleagues, should not evoke any particular public concern. Thus, 
                the reviewers from the WG NEO agree with the authors in ruling 
                out any danger to Earth from 1999 AN10 in the next forty years. 
                The object will be followed closely over the next several years 
                in order to define the longer-term properties of its orbit more 
                accurately, as will be the case with numerous other, similar objects 
                that will be continue to be discovered over the next several years 
                as NEO searches intensify and orbital computation methods improve.</p>
              <p align="LEFT">3) COMMENTS FROM BENNY PEISER TO THE CCNET NEWSGROUP 
                (13 APRIL) ASTEROID 1999 AN10 ON POTENTIAL COLLISION COURSE WITH 
                EARTH IN 2039 - AND NOBODY SEEMS WILLING TO INFORM THE PUBLIC 
              </p>
              <p align="LEFT"> Imagine a newly discovered asteroid, some one mile 
                in diameter, is on a potential collision course with Earth in 
                just 40 years - and no one is telling you about it. This is exactly 
                what is happening with asteroid 1999 AN10. By pure coincidence, 
                I have come across a research paper by Andrea Milani, Steven R. 
                Chesley and Giovanni B. Valsecchi on the potential risk of 1999 
                AN10 hitting the Earth in forty years time. Yet instead of informing 
                the interested public about their potentially explosive findings, 
                the authors have hidden away their results on an obscure web page. 
                The asteroid, known as 1999 AN10, was discovered by LINEAR on 
                13 January 1999. According to the Italian researchers, the object 
                will come particularly close to Earth in August 2027. No impact 
                is possible in that year, but there is a small chance that the 
                asteroid will be perturbed in such a way that it might impact 
                the Earth in 2039. While the chance of an actual collision is 
                small, one is not entirely out of the question. Moreover, the 
                extremely chaotic behaviour of this asteroid makes it impossible 
                to predict all possible approaches for more than a few decades 
                after any close encounter, but the orbit will remain dangerously 
                close to the orbit of the Earth for about 600 years. If this information 
                reminds you of the 1997 XF11 affair, you are spot on. It is in 
                fact only the second time in history that a major impact in the 
                near future cannot be ruled out altogether. And yet there is at 
                one major difference: At least we were informed about 1997 XF11 
                once a potential hazard became clear. In the case of 1999 AN10, 
                however, it is pure accident that you hear about the information 
                via the CCNet rather than through an official press release. Now, 
                what is really worrying about 1999 AN10 is not the statistically 
                very small impact risk. Nobody needs to lose any sleep due to 
                this object. What is really disturbing, however, is the unnecessary 
                and detrimental secrecy that surrounds this object. There is no 
                reason whatsoever why the findings about 1999 AN10 should not 
                be made available to the general public - unless the findings 
                haven't been checked for general accuracy by other NEO researchers. 
                If, however, no such independent assessment has taken place, the 
                data should not be in the public domain in the first place. Of 
                course, one reason why the authors may have decided to hide their 
                data could be due to the current NASA guidelines on the reporting 
                of impact probabilities by individual NEOs. After all, NASA is 
                threatening researchers with the withdrawal of funding if they 
                dare to publish such sensitive information in any other form than 
                in a peer reviewed medium. Obviously, one's own web site can hardly 
                be considered a peer reviewed journal. One therefore has to wonder 
                why such relevant information is put into the public domain in 
                such a wired and secretive way. The 1999 AN10 'affair', in my 
                view, should be seen as a rather damaging consequence of the over-reaction 
                regarding asteroid 1997 XF11. Moreover, I would argue that the 
                unclear and intimidating NASA guidelines on NEO reporting should 
                be dropped in their present form since they have become part of 
                the problem. Instead, international procedures (which would acknowledge 
                a certain level of scientific uncertainty regarding some particular 
                PHAs) should replace those ill-considered NASA guidelines which 
                were imposed in a rash last year. In order not to repeat last 
                year's mistakes, the discussion should be focused on an international 
                procedure of how future impact risk calculations (and their inherent 
                uncertainties!) should be reported in a satisfactory way. </p>

                Dear Benny- We strenuously object to your characterization of 
                our actions regarding this paper, and to your attempts to sensationalize 
                our work. This whole thing could have been explained easily if 
                you had contacted one of us, but that apparently does not suit 
                your purposes. Instead you released a uninformed report filled 
                with speculation and innuendo. We have submitted the paper in 
                question to a journal, so it is undergoing the usual peer review 
                process even now. It is customary for researchers to make available, 
                through a variety of means, papers which are at all stages of 
                the publication and review process, even work still in preparation. 
                This fosters discussion among the community, and is an essential 
                component of the modern scientific method. In addition to submitting 
                to a journal we have voluntarily sent the paper to more than a 
                dozen international experts and officials for comment and criticism 
                before we made the article available on the Internet. This review 
                has been going on for more than two weeks now, and in fact some 
                technical issues that we raise are still under discussion, but, 
                fundamentally, the content of our report has been well received. 
                (We posted the information to the Internet on April 6, about one 
                week after selectively releasing the paper.) This additional level 
                of review was done voluntarily on our part as we did not want 
                to make available erroneous or misleading information, which many 
                perceive was done in the 1997 XF11 scare. We also wanted to be 
                in a position to issue a controlled release to the public after 
                all issues have been confirmed by our independently convened panel 
                of experts, should that be deemed necessary. In the end a consensus 
                among the experts was quickly reached that this object does not 
                fit any realistic criteria of imminent danger, so we decided to 
                follow normal channels with the paper. This entails submitting 
                the article to a journal and posting to the Internet as a preprint. 
                More than likely, you stumbled upon the paper via Andrea's preprint 
                page (hardly an "obscure web page"): http://virmap.unipi.it/~milani/preprints/preprint.html 
                You should note that some of the other papers listed there are 
                also currently under review for publication by scientific journals. 
                Indeed the paper in question is specified as "submitted." It is 
                not our custom to contact the media every time we write a paper, 
                nor is it customary to treat papers undergoing the peer review 
                process as secret. Imagine a newly discovered asteroid, some one 
                mile in diameter, is on a potential collision course with Earth 
                in just 40 years - and no one is telling you about it. This is 
                exactly what is happening with asteroid 1999 AN10. Your opening 
                paragraph (above) clearly indicates that you are trying to spark 
                fear and controversy where none is warranted. You later call our 
                results potentially explosive, but then go on to say that the 
                risk of collision is small enough to be considered negligible. 
                So which is it? This is the fundamental flaw in your claim that 
                we had some obligation to broadcast this work as widely as possible 
                to the general public. Either it is of urgent concern, or it is 
                not. Your claim that "unnecessary and detrimental secrecy" surrounds 
                this object is based on an assumption that this paper presents 
                time critical information which morally obligates us to notify 
                the public, the press, the United Nations, and the commander of 
                the Enterprise. This is clearly not the case here, and so your 
                argument is invalid, even paradoxical. If the important thing 
                is the lack of a press release rather than the risk of collision, 
                as you stated, then there was nothing to release outside of normal 
                scientific channels. You make the point that this case has been 
                handled differently from the XF11 affair, and you are right. In 
                the XF11 scare, a possibility of collision in 2028 was announced, 
                when such possibility did not exist, even based on the then available 
                information. 1999 AN10 is qualitatively similar except that in 
                the cases where there is a non-negligible chance of a very deep 
                encounter (2027 and 2034), we have explicitly stated that collision 
                is not possible. The risk in 2039 is, of course, negligible. Your 
                speculation that we have decided to hide this report for fear 
                of losing our NASA funding is demonstrably false for two reasons. 
                First we have no financial support from NASA, and second, if we 
                were hiding our results you certainly would not have found them 
                published on the Internet. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this 
                proposal was only a proposal, and it was never implemented. We 
                have scrupulously followed normal conventions for the release 
                of scientific data. Aware that this report could be sensationalized, 
                we submitted it to review by the panel of experts. This was done 
                voluntarily, but we also hope to set a precedent with this action. 
                As a result of this case the IAU is moving rapidly to formally 
                establish voluntary guidelines and procedures to be followed in 
                future cases. Their plans are closely modeled on our approach. 
                Under this policy, researchers would submit their results to an 
                ad hoc committee of experts for comment and criticism before going 
                public. How long this delay should last is unclear, but probably 
                would depend on the urgency of the situation, anywhere from 2-5 
                days. After that period the author could release the information 
                in any manner deemed appropriate, and the officials and agencies 
                first confronted by the press will be able to respond with an 
                informed discussion of the threat. This responsibility to seek 
                confirmation before going public becomes even more critical for 
                more threatening situations. You may object to this policy, but 
                we expect that in the future virtually all researchers in the 
                Earth hazard community will be following it. We are sorry to report 
                that the reason these voluntary guidelines are necessary is to 
                thwart those in the press who would seek to sensationalize reports 
                of potential impact, no matter how carefully we word them. In 
                that sense you are part of the problem, Benny, and a careful and 
                deliberate release of information is only a response to irresponsible 
                actions such as yours. 1999 AN10 itself holds very little relevance 
                to the general public. If our research does have any relevance 
                for the public at large, it is because we have developed a general 
                theory that can rule out impact for some finite period of time, 
                yet it also shows that we can say very little about the possibility 
                of collision for times beyond that point, because each encounter 
                predicted by our theory can spawn more close encounters, a cascade 
                too complex to be analyzed. The good news is that the further 
                down the cascade we go, the lower the probability of impact should 
                a collision solution exist. The essential point is that we feel 
                that this paper should not be used to confuse the general public, 
                and we strenuously object to your accusations that the information 
                was handled irresponsibly. You will have a very hard time to find 
                a scientist who will accuse us of a lack of openness in our research. 
                An important point: We want to avoid the perception of crying 
                wolf when we say in April that a collision is possible, while 
                in July, after more observations become available, we will almost 
                certainly report that a collision is no longer possible. We have 
                verified that the object cannot hit the Earth in the next 40 years, 
                far longer than any threat mitigation would require. And in a 
                few months, when there is less uncertainty in the orbit, the picture 
                will be very different from the one we have now. </p>

              <p align="LEFT">The "1999 AN10 Affair" is nothing more than the 
                scientific peer review process at work. The authors have asked 
                scientific colleagues to examine and verify their results prior 
                to issuing any IAU Circular or Press Information Sheet. Better 
                still, the authors intend to publish their results in the refereed 
                literature. The authors are to be applauded for doing it right, 
                that is, they are making sure their results are correct before 
                making any public announcement, and they will provide their full 
                analysis for scrutiny within the professional literature. The

                (or even months) required for the scientific review process to

                NASA IS HOLDING NO GUN TO THE HEAD OF ITALIAN RESEARCHERS </p>
              <p align="LEFT">I regret the misleading wording you have chosen 
                to use (both in your heading and in your text) in announcing the 
                Milani study of 1999 AN10 to CCNet subscribers. You have written 
                that "the chance of an actual collision is small, but one is not 
                entirely out of the question." In the context of the impact hazard, 
                those were the words used 13 months ago to describe a very different 
                situation. When used about 1997 XF11 in an official IAU statement, 
                they implied -- to both the writer, who had a mistaken concept 
                of the distribution of errors (see IAU Circular 6879), and to 
                scientifically literate readers (see Stuart Goldman's sidebar 
                on pg. 33, June 1998 SKY & TELESCOPE) -- a probability of impact 
                of order 1 in 1000. Milani estimates that the chance of impact 
                by 1999 AN10 is of order 1 in a billion (1 in a thousand million), 
                a factor of a million smaller than the mistaken estimate of 1997 
                XF11's impact probability. He estimates the impact probability 
                as 10,000 times less than the chance that the Earth will be struck 
                by some as-yet-undiscovered kilometer sized object NEXT YEAR! 
                That makes 1999 AN10 a matter of scientific interest, but of no 
                practical interest and hardly meriting the "official press release" 
                you call for. (Unless, of course, you are the sort of person who 
                worries about being killed by snakes while you drive around town 
                chain-smoking and not wearing a seat-belt.) Use of the same wording 
                to describe probabilities that differ by a factor of a million 
                can only serve to confuse a literate, rational understanding of 
                risk. You obviously used this wording in an ironic, argumentative 
                way, rather than as an attempt to confuse. But the point needs 
                to be made, if society is to address risks in a rational way, 
                that the quantitative difference of a factor of a million makes 
                for an *enormous* qualitative difference. That is why the XF11 
                announcement would have *deserved* the world-wide headlines, had 
                it been true, while the AN10 matter has no relevance to the "man-on-the-street" 
                whatsoever. Andrea Milani has been very responsible in having 
                other experts check his work before posting his results on his 
                public web site. There is no rational reason, however, for Milani 
                to have called a press conference, or offered his results to CCNet, 
                and risked an unwarranted sensation (like you seem to be trying 
                to provoke) from a misunderstanding of his result, which is irrelevant 
                in the larger scheme of things. Such an announcement would attach 
                undue importance to an arcane result. People like yourself, who 
                are interested in the impact hazard, have long been aware of Milani's 
                website, so his work was hardly "hidden" away. NASA is holding 
                no gun to the head of a researcher at an Italian university, so 
                your remarks about NASA intimidation seem to be off-track. There 
                is room, of course, for legitimate debate about how to handle 
                matters of potential practical interest in a responsible way, 
                so that the public isn't misled by faulty, premature results but 
                yet *is* told about potentially important matters in a timely 
                fashion. This is a dilemma long-faced by emergency preparedness 
                officials in communities and nations around the world who have 
                tried to establish responsible protocols, but there are no easy 
                answers. Your apparent belief, Benny, that every infinitesimal 
                threat needs to be announced in a press release seems to me to 
                be a step in the wrong direction. Clark R. Chapman Southwest Research

                MANAGING THE KNOWLEGE OF HAZARDOUS ASTEROIDS</p>
              <p align="LEFT"> The current debate about Asteroid 1999 AN10 amongst 
                astronomers and others in the scientific community is mainly concerned 
                with the manner in which information about potentially hazardous 
                asteroids is released to the public. This issue has received considerable 
                attention since April 1998 when a "false alarm" was raised about 
                another asteroid (1997 XF11). A working group of the International 
                Astronomical Union is apparently preparing guidelines for announcement 
                of possible impacts and the 1999 AN10 "incident" should help that 
                group review its work. As a nonscientist who is trying, on a voluntary 
                basis, to get a major NEO search effort re-established in Australia, 
                I would like to offer some comments on this issue. Firstly, I 
                believe the common goal is to protect the Earth from the consequences 
                of impacts by asteroids and comets. This involves: a) detecting 
                near earth objects b) establishing the orbital parameters of newly 
                detected objects c) predicting future orbits d) identifying potential 
                collisions with the Earth e) verifying predictions of collisions 
                to a high degree of accuracy f) implementing measures to avert 
                or mitigate a collision (including tsunami effects) Items (a) 
                to (d) are relatively low-cost, "routine" activities that are 
                well described in the Spaceguard Proposal on NASA's Web site. 
                The entire cost of a ten year, worldwide Spaceguard Survey is 
                about US$100 million -- apparently equivalent to US military expenditure 
                for just two days in the Balkan Conflict! Despite the low cost 
                of this "insurance for mankind," efforts to introduce a worldwide 
                Spaceguard Survey appear to have stalled -- advisors to government 
                don't seem to take the issue seriously (in fact, I have questioned 
                whether Spaceguard is too cheap for its own good). Several groups 
                around the world have been working on this by lobbying politicians 
                and key scientists. "False alarms" don't help this effort and 
                also unfairly undermine the credibility of scientists working 
                in the field. It turns out that the authors of the paper describing 
                the potential hazard of Asteroid 1999 AN10 had submitted it for 
                peer review prior to making a "preprint" available on the Internet. 
                This is entirely appropriate -- the difficulty is deciding at 
                what stage the media should be informed and how such information 
                should be worded in order to not raise undue alarm. Brian Marsden 
                from the Minor Planet Centre has pointed out that 1999 AN10 was 
                added to the list of "Potentially Hazardous Asteroids" on February 
                16, well before the Italian paper was posted on the Internet. 
                There are media relations precedents in other fields such as the 
                release of economic indicators -- everyone knows that the statistics 
                are analysed by competent people over several weeks but that public 
                release of the results will take place on a certain day. Another 
                (perhaps more relevant) analogy is where a medical doctor detects 
                a potentially cancerous growth on a patient and sends a sample 
                away for pathology tests. The patient is told that it will take 
                a certain time (usually days) before the results of the tests 
                are available. My suggestion is that there be a similar "official" 
                delay in the announcement of the results of NEO impact assessments. 
                People would know that sufficient information had been gathered 
                to enable orbit calculations to be undertaken, that one or more 
                groups were performing these calculations and that an announcement 
                of the results be issued (probably by MPC) on a certain day (say 
                two months after its inclusion on the PHA list). As several people 
                in the NEO field have pointed out, there really is no need for 
                urgency in the release of these results. A related issue is the 
                need for consistency in terminology amongst spokesperson scientists 
                when dealing with the press. Terms such as "potentially hazardous", 
                "especially dangerous" (Brian Marsden's suggestion), "possible 
                impact" and expressions of probability need to be clearly defined 
                and some poorly understood terms need to be avoided altogether. 
                Richard Binzel's suggestion for a scale of impact hazards, similar 
                to the Richter Scale for earthquakes, has merit. Of course, anyone 
                commenting on an impact hazard issue should bear in mind the likelihood 
                that some sections of the media will sensationalise the story.

                SCIENTISTS SAY ASTEROID MAY TANGO WITH EARTH </p>
              <p align="LEFT">By David L. Chandler, Globe Staff, 04/14/99- In 
                a discovery eerily reminiscent of one made just a year ago, astronomers 
                have found an asteroid that will come quite close to Earth in 
                a few decades, and that even has a real but minuscule possibility 
                of an impact. Last year, astronomers made a similar discovery 
                of an asteroid that they said had a slight possibility of hitting 
                Earth in about 40 years. In that case, it was quickly determined 
                that the Earth was safe after all, and astronomers have been arguing 
                ever since about the way the original report was disseminated. 
                The latest asteroid, called 1999 AN10, was described in a detailed 
                scientific paper posted on a Web site by three astronomers. But 
                unlike last year's case, no information has been sent directly 
                to the public and the press. The asteroid is thought to be about 
                a mile in diameter - similar to the one last year - and could 
                possibly come very close to Earth in 2039. There is about a one-in-a-billion 
                chance that it could strike the Earth that year, with devastating 
                consequences. That is less than the risk that an unknown asteroid 
                or comet might hit Earth on any given day, and therefore is not 
                anything to be too concerned about. What might be more worrisome, 
                scientists said, is its long-term potential. For the next 600 
                years, according to astronomers Andrea Milani, Steven Chesley, 
                and Giovanni Valsecchi, the asteroid could remain very close to 
                Earth, and if it comes close enough to be affected by Earth's 
                gravity its orbit could become chaotic and impossible to predict 
                for more than a decade or two ahead. In that case, the asteroid 
                would require constant, careful monitoring for centuries to guard 
                against a possible impact. This is only the second time in history 
                - or perhaps the first time, depending on whose analysis of last 
                year's discovery you believe - that an asteroid has been discovered 
                that has a small but non-zero possibility of striking the Earth 
                within a few decades. Even though the likelihood is quite small, 
                that makes it an interesting find. Some people have questioned 
                the wisdom of the changes in the way such information is disseminated 
                as a result of what many astronomers considered a serious public 
                embarrassment last year. British anthropologist Benny Peiser, 
                who has written extensively about the effects of past impacts 
                on the Earth, yesterday circulated an e-mail message questioning 
                why this discovery, unlike last year's, has not been announced 
                publicly or shared with news organizations. While acknowledging 
                that the risk of the asteroid hitting the Earth is tiny and not 
                something that anyone should lose any sleep over, Peiser said 
                that he found the lack of public notice disturbing, suggesting 
                that it reflects an overreaction to astronomers' embarrassment 
                about last year's announcement followed by a swift reversal. But 
                astronomers contacted yesterday said that they see this latest 
                case as a perfect example of how such information should be handled. 
                The astronomers who made the calculations of impact probabilities 
                have circulated their unpublished paper to several colleagues 
                around the world who specialize in such calculations, in order 
                to make sure their conclusions are correct. Some astronomers contacted 
                yesterday said that all the comments so far from such specialists 
                have been positive. "I commend them for the process of being careful," 
                said Richard Binzel, an astronomer at Massachusetts Institute 
                of Technology who specializes in asteroids. </p>
              <p align="LEFT">9) SUMMARY COMMENTS BY PAUL CHODAS ON JPL WEBSITE 
                (21 APRIL) </p>
              <p align="LEFT">Comments on Potentially Hazardous Asteroid 1999 
                AN10 </p>
              <p align="LEFT">Asteroid 1999 AN10 made the news recently because, 
                according to a group of researchers in Italy, there is a remote 
                possibility that it could collide with the Earth in the year 2039. 
                Writing in a scientific paper submitted for publication, researchers 
                Andrea Milani, Steven R. Chesley and Giovanni B. Valsecchi say 
                that the chance of a collision in 2039 is exceedingly small, only 
                about one in a billion, but they add that the asteroid's orbit 
                will remain threateningly close to the Earth's orbit for many 
                centuries to come. </p>
              <p align="LEFT">Although the threat posed by 1999 AN10 must certainly 
                be taken seriously, the probability of impact for this object 
                is so miniscule that the authors of the paper felt no great urgency 
                to inform the press of the new calculations, and the other NEO 
                scientists reviewing the paper agreed with this policy. To put 
                it into perspective, consider that the probability of 1999 AN10 
                impacting in 2039 is tens of thousands of times *less* than the 
                probability of an undiscovered asteroid of equivalent size hitting 
                the Earth during the same 40-year period. Furthermore, in just 
                a few months, 1999 AN10 will be observed again, as it moves back 
                into the nighttime sky, and the new data will, in all likelihood, 
                completely eliminate the possibility of impact in 2039. Researchers 
                should then be able to start examining the possibility of impacts 
                after 2039. </p>
              <p align="LEFT">As it turned out, the Milani et al. paper was publicized 
                not by the authors, but by a third party who found it accidentally 
                on one of the author's web pages; the authors were not even consulted 
                before their results were publicized. An internet debate ensued 
                on such issues as why the results had not been made public, and 
                whether or not the paper had been peer-reviewed to ensure accuracy. 
                The reasons for not making the results public have already been 
                described: basically, there was no great urgency to publicize 
                a one-in-a-billion-chance impact 40 years from now, when even 
                that remote a possibility will likely disappear in a few months. 
              </p>
              <p align="LEFT">On the issue of peer review, Milani and his colleagues 
                followed a commendable course. The authors distributed their paper 
                to qualified experts more than a week before placing the paper 
                on their web page, seeking confirmation of their results. Our 
                group at JPL examined the paper and saw no major flaws. We have 
                also confirmed the existence of the impact scenario for 2039, 
                and we confirm that the probability of impact in 2039 is about 
                one in a billion. Paul W. Chodas NEO Program Office April 21,
