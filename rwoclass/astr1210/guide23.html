From the history of science, it's obvious that human beings have a
deep urge to understand nature and the universe around them.  We are
the first species on our planet to have the desire and capacity to
confront questions on a cosmic scale.  The first recorded serious
explorations were made over 2500 years ago, and since then we have
invested tremendous effort into investigating basic questions about
the mechanisms of nature and the place of humans in the universe. </p>

Modern science has made great progress by insisting on <b>strict
standards of evidence</b>.  And, after 500 years, we now have a very
good, if still
<b>preliminary</b>, understanding of many aspects of the universe.
The length of time it took to get meaningful answers indicates how difficult
it is to obtain reliable knowledge on this scale.</p>

One of the biggest unanswered questions concerns the presence of other
lifeforms beyond the Earth.  In fact, the most powerful impact of
astronomy on popular thinking concerns something that it hasn't
discovered yet and possibly never will: <b><em>aliens</em></b>.</p>

So, in this lecture we examine the questions of <b>whether
there is life elsewhere in the cosmos</b>, where it might be,
and what forms it might take.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2> A. Perspective</h2>

The two questions at the top of the page frame the
possibilities for the existence of other advanced species in the
universe.  </p>

When you combine the ideas of <b><em>life</em></b> and <b><em>the universe</em></b>
you reach a <b>stunning conclusion</b> no matter which way you argue:</p>

<ul>

<!--  <a href="im/MW-field-color.jpg">  <a href="im/HUDF-color-lg.jpg"> -->

<li> There are <b>billions of stars</b> in each galaxy and
about <b>100 billion galaxies</b> within reach of our
telescopes. (See <a href="guide02.html" > Study Guide 2</a>.)</p>

<ul>

<!-- detectable (in the aggregate) with present technology  -->

The total number of stars  in the observable universe 
 is of order 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (or 10<sup>22</sup>).  </p>

</ul>

<li> Therefore: </p>

<ul>

<li> If you believe Earth and humanity are <b>special</b>, uniquely
fortunate, or specially created (the "pre-Copernican" view), then we are
<b>ALONE</b> in this unimaginably vast cosmos.</p>

<li> On the other hand, if you believe we are <b>average</b> (the
"Copernican" view), then the universe <b>TEEMS</b> with billions of
advanced lifeforms.</p>

</ul>
</ul>

<!-- <font color="#aa00cc"> -->

Most astronomers subscribe to the latter view---that conditions
on Earth are typical (or at least not uncommon)---which implies
that <b>extraterrestrial life is widespread and that there are many
advanced lifeforms</b>.</p>

<!-- gone 4/13: "http://www.phys.uu.nl/%7Ehuygens/cosmotheoros_en.htm" -->

<ul>

This is not just a modern point of view.  It goes back to the ancient
Greeks and was historically advocated by many other writers,
e.g. Huygens, the discoverer of Saturn's moon Titan.

<h3>A revolution in prospects for astrobiology</h3>

<ul>

Several remarkable discoveries lend credence to this picture:
</p>

<ol>

<li> 1995+: The <a href="guide11.html"><b>discovery of planetary
systems around nearby stars</b> (see Guide 11)</a>.  We have
discovered hundreds of other planetary systems in the last 25 years.
<b>Many, if not most, stars like the Sun have planets</b>.  Despite
the technical challenges, we have already identified many Earth-size
candidate planets. </p>

<ul> In April 2014, the discovery of
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/ames/kepler/nasas-kepler-discovers-first-earth-size-planet-in-the-habitable-zone-of-another-star/#.U1gzJceLlOE">Kepler
186-f</a>, the first Earth-sized planet (only 10% larger) in the
<a href="#habzone">"habitable zone"</a> around another star,
was announced.  </p>

</ul>

<!-- 12/12: Little supporting evidence for this interpretation.  Downplay
it for now.  -->

<li> 1996: Evidence suggesting the presence
of <a href="guide17.html"><b>fossil microorganisms on Mars </b>(see
Guide 17)</a>.  This claim is highly controversial.  But
right or wrong, it has stimulated the development of vigorous research
in the rapidly growing field of <b>"Astrobiology."</b>  </p>


<li> The <b>discovery of water-rich environments</b> on 
<a href="http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/rwoclass/astr1210/marsImages.html">
<b>Mars</b></a> (in the past) and under the surfaces
of <a href="guide20.html"><b>Europa</b></a>
and <a href="guide20.html"><b>Enceladus</b></a>.  And the strange and
unique but promising <b>hydrocarbon-rich</b> surface
of <a href="guide20.html"><b>Titan</b></a>.</p>

<li> The discovery by radio astronomers of many 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_interstellar_and_circumstellar_molecules"><b>complex
organic molecules in interstellar clouds</b></a>.  The list of
these has been rapidly growing over the past 20 years.  There are over
220 species of interstellar molecules, many containing more than 8
atoms.  These include the amino acid glycine, the RNA base uracil, and
the sugar glycolaldehyde.  The basic building blocks of biological
organisms are widespread in our Galaxy.</p>

</ol>

These breakthroughs, coming after centuries of speculation,
have changed the whole character of the study of exterrestrial
life.</p>

</ul>

<p><br></p>

<h2>B. Life on Earth </p></h2>

Just as our everyday "common-sense" perspective provides no clue to the scale
of the real universe, our naive assumptions about the nature of life
on Earth, as they existed at the beginning of the scientific age, have
been shattered by the evidence:</p>

<ul>

<b>Age</b>: Life on Earth is <b>ancient</b>.  It has thrived for at
least <b>3 billion years</b>, according to the fossil record, and the
character of lifeforms has changed radically throughout that time. </p>

<ul>
Human beings, on the other hand, are brand new.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo">genus Homo</a>, which
includes modern humans, has existed for only about 2.5 million years,
or 0.06% of the age of the Earth.  <em>Homo sapiens</em> emerged
only about <b>250,000 years ago</b>. </p>
</ul>


<b>Functional basis</b>:  <b>random chemical interactions, governed by natural physical
principles</b>. </p>

<ul>
   
    In contradiction to all expectations through about 1900, no
    special <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalism">"vital
    force"</a> is required.  The laws of physics and chemistry that
    govern the structure and functioning of organic systems
    are <b>exactly the same</b> as those that govern inorganic
    systems.</p>
</ul>


<b>Unity</b>:  Despite extraordinary external diversity, there is only
<b>one type</b> of terrestrial life at the <b>molecular level</b></p>

<ul>

<li> A <b>small</b> set of basic chemical building blocks (large molecules
constructed from abundant atoms like H,C,N,O, and a few others)</p>

<li>  The key constituent is <b>carbon</b>, which offers 4 chemical bonds as
the basis for forming complex molecules </p>

<li> <b><em>Nucleic acids</em></b> (DNA, RNA): These long strand
molecules provide an enormous capacity for information storage and
chemical control for molecular reproduction </p>

<!-- (Crick, Watson 1953)  -->

</center>


<h2>C. Evolution</h2>

The proliferation and diversification of lifeforms is produced by <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"
><b>evolution through natural selection</b></a> for
better adapted types (Darwin, Wallace 1858)</p>

<ul> The <b>basic principle</b> of evolution is very simple: those
organisms that are best adapted by their genetic makeup to a given
environment thrive and pass those favorable genetics on to subsequent
generations.  Dispersion in genetic material in each generation is
guaranteed by chemical mutations. Mutations that are accidentally
favorable are amplified by natural selection and propagate forward
into modified species.  On Earth, there have been hundreds of millions
of generations preceding the familiar lifeforms we see around us
today.  The consequent adaptation to an immense variety of
environmental niches is profound. </p>

</ul>

Despite the raging "creationism," "intelligent design," and other
controversies surrounding Darwinian evolution that get prominence in
the media, and sometimes state legislatures,  biological evolution is
as well established a <b>basic fact</b> of science as any other,
e.g. that Earth is a planet or that the Sun is a star.</p>

<b>All the basic "predictions" of Darwinian evolution have been
thoroughly confirmed</b> in the last 150 years of biology, physics,
astronomy, geophysics, and paleontology.  The evidence is
<b>overwhelming</b>.  </p>

<ul>

<li> The
<a href="http://www.fossilmuseum.net/" >
fossil record</a> is now fabulously rich (250,000
species)---vastly more so than in Darwin's day---and clearly shows the
<b>radical change of lifeforms on Earth</b> through time.   Huge fossil
collections exist for epochs between 10,000 and 500,000,000 years ago.</p>

<li>  Geological <b>age-dating by <a
href="guide12.html#radiodating" >radioactive isotopes</a></b> is now
highly accurate and graphically reveals the <b>enormous stretch of time</b>
over which evolution on Earth has been working.</p>

<!-- 
<ul> Recall the time scale analogy from the first lecture: if our
textbook represents the age of the Earth, each <b>letter</b> in the
book is equivalent to 3000 years! </p>
</ul>
-->

<li> <b>Genetics</b>, the mechanism by which <b>inherited characteristics</b> are
passed from one generation to the next, was mysterious in Darwin's time
but is now thoroughly understood, as are the causes of the
<b>mutations</b> that engender changes in species.</p>

<li> DNA mapping has recently demonstrated astonishing <b>chemical
similarities between humans and other higher lifeforms</b>.  We share
98.8% of our genes with chimpanzees.</p>

<ul>
It is now clear that <b>humans are part of a
continuum of life on Earth</b>, not a special class. </p>

This is probably the <b>most stringest test</b> of evolutionary biology ever
made, and it passed with flying colors. Darwin, Huxley, and the other
leading biologists up to 75 years ago could not have imagined how
precise or conclusive such chemical tests of the evolutionary
principle could be. </p>

</ul>
</ul>

The astronomical evidence for <b>evolution of the universe</b> and its
contents over a period of 10-15 billion years is <b>as strong</b> as, but
<b>entirely independent</b> of, the biological & paleontological evidence for
evolution of life on Earth.  See <a href="guide02.html">Study Guide 2</a>
and links therein.</p>

<ul>

<li> An apparent contradiction between the age of the Sun, in
Darwin's time thought to be only about 30 million years, and the
geological/fossil time-scale (much older) was resolved when physicists
realized (ca. 1940) that the source of the Sun's energy was <b>nuclear
fusion</b>, for which there is abundant fuel to maintain the Sun's
enormous luminosity for much longer periods.  The Sun's age is now
estimated to be about <b>5 billion years</b>, and the solar and
geological time-scales are now in good agreement.</p>

<li> Detailed measurements of the brightnesses and colors of stars in
<b>star clusters</b> permit us to age-date their formation times.  These
range from about 10 million years for clusters in active star-forming
regions to <b>13 billion years</b> in the case of "globular clusters" like <a
href="im/m80-hst-heritage.jpg" >M80</a>.</p>

<li> By using powerful telescopes to study the <a href="HDF.html"
>Hubble Deep Field</a> and other distant regions, astronomers
can <b>observe the universe as it was billions of years ago</b>.  No
other field of science is able to make such <b>direct observations of
the distant past</b>.  Not only can we see the past, we also can
determine how different the contents of the universe were at earlier
times and
trace <a href="im/cosmic-SFRD-z0-8-madau-rev14-fig9-label.jpg">how
they change with "lookback time."</a> There is no doubt that the universe
has evolved.
</p>

<li> Spacecraft observations of the <a href="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/"
> <em>cosmic background radiation</em></a>
from the Big Bang have recently determined the age of the universe to
be <b>13.7 billion years</b>.  </p>

</ul>

<!-- (mainly in the US, not other countries).  -->

<b>Controversies</b> over the reality of evolution are confined to political,
religious, & education circles.</p>

<ul>

They
are <b>not</b> important among active scientists, who accept evolution
as a foundation of modern science.  Scientists involve themselves in
these controversies only insofar as they try to protect the integrity
of their disciplines and of science education from political
intrusion.  </p> 

In these debates, evolution is often mistakenly conflated with the
question of the <b>origin</b> of life on Earth.  Scientists do not
presently have a good understanding of how (or even whether) life
originated on Earth.  That discussion is hypothetical.  The evidence
for evolution (that is, for a <b>change over time</b>) of lifeforms on
Earth, however, is entirely independent of the question of life's
origins.  You do not have to know where a sapling came from in
order to know that a tree is growing.</p>

</ul>

Most anti-evolution arguments are conceptually medieval.  <b>You
can disregard evolution <em>only if you are prepared to disregard
the rest of modern science</em></b> and scientific thinking.
Beware of those who urge you to do this.  </p>

<p><br></p>


<h2>D.  Origin of Life on Earth?</h2>

As just noted, we do not have a good understanding of how life
originated on Earth.  Given what we do know, however, it is plausible
that the chain of life began at the molecular level with 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis"><b>molecular
evolution</b></a> from simple, abundant, pre-organic chemicals.</p>

<ul>

<li> Probably in <b>oceans</b>, a dense medium with vast quantities of basic
 raw materials. </p>

<li> Biosynthesis requires sufficient <b>sources of energy</b>, but
     these are abundant in the early Earth environment: solar
     radiation, vulcanism, ocean vents, lightning, etc. </p>

<li> The <b>plausibility</b> of early molecular evolution was demonstrated in
a classic 1953 laboratory simulation:
the <a href="im/miller-urey-exp.jpg"><b>Miller-Urey
experiment</b></a>.  Starting from common pre-biotic ingredients
thought to be characteristic of the early Earth, sugars, amino acids,
and DNA bases were generated in only a <b>few days</b>.  This showed
how easy it is to start a chemical synthesis sequence that can lead to
organisms.</p>

<li> Note that once it begins, molecular evolution is subject
through natural selection to the same kind of acceleration toward
survivable and proliferating forms as are biological organisms. 
Molecular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocatalysis">
autocatalysis</a> probably plays an important role here.</p>

<li> Discoveries of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile">"extremophiles"</a>
 --- organisms thriving under unexpectedly harsh conditions of
temperature, pressure, or acidity --- demonstrate how <b>robust and
adaptable</b> simple life forms can be.   The best-known examples are
bacteria that live at temperatures of 120C or pressures of 1000 bars
in submarine hydrothermal vents or deep ocean trenches. </p>

<li> For 3/4 of its history, life on Earth consisted only of 
<a href="im/early-life-on-Earth-timescale.jpg">very simple
organisms</a>, entirely unlike the profusion of advanced types seen
today.  Numerically, the simple organisms, starting with bacteria and
viruses, 
<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/phenomena/2013/02/20/an-infinity-of-viruses/">
vastly outnumber</a> the more complex types even now.  </p>

</ul>

An alternative to a terrestrial origin for life
is <b><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia">panspermia</a></em></b>:
the seeding of Earth from an <b>external source</b>, accidental or
deliberate.  Remarkably, this possibility was first suggested by the
Greek
philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaxagoras">Anaxagoras</a>
around 450 BC. </p>

<ul> 

<li> We have discovered that organic molecules, produced by natural chemical
processes,  are present in large
 quantities even in ostensibly hostile cosmic environments such as
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murchison_meteorite">
 meteorites</a>
 or <a href="https://public.nrao.edu/news/pressreleases/2016-chiral-gbt">interstellar
 clouds</a>.  These could be the building blocks for biogenesis throughout our
 Galaxy.</p>

<li> An obvious way for lifeforms to propagate in a given planetary system
is through <b>comets or meteoroids</b>, as the <a href="guide17.html"
>"SNC" meteorites from Mars</a> vividly demonstrate.  Meteoroids could
have spread Mars life to Earth or vice versa. <b> <em>We</em> could be
Martians!</b></p>

<li> The notion of panspermia simply pushes the question of how life
originated back one level.  Panspermia has occasionally been very 
controversial -- for example, when astronomers 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandra_Wickramasinghe">Chandra
Wickramasinghe and Fred Hoyle</a> suggested that infall of
interplanetary dust grains carrying nucleic acids might have caused
disease outbreaks on Earth.  But at present we cannot determine
whether life originated on Earth itself or came here from
elsewhere.</p>

<ul>
Introducing the possibility of panspermia doesn't, unfortunately,
resolve the important question of whether early terrestrial conditions were
favorable to the origin of Earth-like lifeforms.  If life came here
from elsewhere, it could have been because the early Earth was hostile
to generating lifeforms.  Or, Earth could have been perfectly
hospitable to biogenesis, but the external seeding occurred before
it could take place.</p>

</center>



<h2>E. Life Elsewhere in Our Solar System</h2>

Are there <b>plausible biospheres elsewhere</b> in the Solar System?</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>

<li> Raw materials; <br>
<li> A dense medium (preferably <b>water</b>, but other liquids/dense gases are possible); <br>
<li> A protected environment, maintained in the appropriate temperature/pressure range;<br>
<li> Energy sources; primarily sunlight, but volcanic vents, lightning, interior heat, etc. are alternatives;<br>
<li> Sufficient <b>time</b> (100 Myr-1 Gyr?) </p>

</ul>

<h3><a name="habzone">Habitable Zone</a></h3>

<ul> For a particular type of parent body (terrestrial planet, Jovian
planet, Jovian satellite, comet), we can define a <b><em>habitable
zone</em></b> as those distances from the parent star for which that
type can offer a comfortable, long-lived biosphere, neither too hot
nor too cold, for life to develop.  For Earth-like life, we believe
that biospheres require the presence of <b>liquid water</b>.  </p>

<!--   Click <a href="im/habitable-zone-Seeds26-11.jpg"
>here</a> for an illustration of zones for Earthlike
planets. </p>   -->

In the solar system, the habitable zone for <b>Earth-like planets</b>
with open bodies of liquid water on their surfaces 
ranges from <b>about 0.9 AU to 1.4 AU</b>, covering the Earth's orbit
(of course) but not reaching to either Venus or Mars.  See the diagram
above.</p>

<ul>
<a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/sky-and-telescope-magazine/what-makes-a-planet-habitable/">Here</a>
is a brief discussion of the factors entering the determination of an
Earth-like habitable zone and a chart that shows where a number of the
exoplanets now known fall. (From <em>Sky & Telescope</em>, March
2017.)</p>

For stars hotter or brighter than the Sun, the zone would be farther
from the star and larger in volume; and the converse for cooler
or fainter stars.</p>

The interest in searching for exoplanets around "cool dwarf" stars,
such as the "K" and "M" stars shown in the diagram above, arises from
the fact that their close-in habitable zones are more easily probed
with current planet detection techniques than those of brighter 
stars (see 
<a href="guide11.html">Study Guide 11</a>).  They are also the most
numerous types of stars.</p>

</ul> 

Because their atmospheres or interiors can be much warmer than their
surfaces and harbor large volumes of liquid water, the habitable zone
for <b>Jovian-type planets or their icy satellites</b> would be <b>much
larger</b>.  Whether life could thrive in such environments, however,
is unknown.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Possibilities</h3>

<ol>

<li> <b>Venus</b>: Its high-temperature, high-pressure, and corrosive
atmosphere is sufficient to sterilize the surface of Venus of all
Earth-like life, so it was long ignored as a possible biosphere.
But in September 2020, astronomers announced the
<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/09/possible-sign-of-life-found-on-venus-phosphine-gas/">tentative
discovery</a> of the molecule phosphine (PH<sub>3</sub>) in the cloud
layers of Venus' atmosphere. On Earth, there is no known
non-biological source for phosphine; so it was suggested that there
are microorganisms thriving in Venus' atmosphere.  Within six weeks,
other groups cast doubt on the detection by reanalyzing the same
datasets.  However this debate turns out, it has been useful in reminding
us that there are regions in Venus' atmosphere that offer temperate
conditions and could possibly harbor floating lifeforms.
 </p>

<li> <b>Mars</b>: There is plausible evidence for a biosphere > 1 Gyr
ago with abundant water (see <a href="guide16.html">Guide16</a>).  SNC
meteorites <a href="guide17.html">provide some evidence for
microorganisms.</a>  The surface is probably too cold and dry now for
life, and the absence of ozone in the present-day atmosphere allows
damaging solar UV flux to penetrate to the surface.  but there could
be warm underground water reservoirs that are more promising.
 </p>

<!-- 
<a href="europaImages.html"  ><img
src="im/europa-galFC-thumb.jpg" align="right" width=22%></a>
-->

<li> <b>Jupiter, Saturn atmospheres</b>:  Results from the <a
href="guide20.html">Galileo probe</a> (1995), which sampled the
outermost layers of Jupiter's atmosphere, were not promising
but don't exclude a biosphere.</p>

<li> The satellites <b><a href="guide20.html">Europa (J) and Enceladus
(S)</a></b> each have evidence for a <b>liquid water
reservoir/ocean</b> lying beneath the visible crust of ice. These are
probably the <b>most promising sites</b> for bio-exploration after
Mars.  <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganymede_%28moon%29">Ganymede</a></b>,
Jupiter's largest moon, has just recently been shown to contain a
subsurface ocean.</p>

<!--   <a href="europaImages.html">Click on
the thumbnail at right for images of Europa.</a> </p>
-->


<li> <b><a href="guide20.html"  >Titan (S)
</a></b> has an extraordinary <b>hydrocarbon-rich atmosphere and
surface</b>, which is a possible biosphere.
The <a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/index.cfm"> Cassini
mission</a> demonstrated the presence of liquid hydrocarbons (methane,
ethane) on Titan, and some scientists think "methanogenic" lifeforms
might exist there.  Most believe the very low temperatures (-180
degrees C) would preclude living organisms on the surface.  As in the
case of Europa, Ganymede, and Enceladus, however, deep reservoirs with
more favorable temperatures are possible.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Titan">Here</a> is a 
prospectus for exobiology on Titan.</p>

<li> <b>Comet nuclei</b>: these icy bodies, often with a
coating of organic molecules, could act as "portable reservoirs" of
organisms; however, temperatures are normally very low.  </p>

<!-- cosmic taxis -->

</ol>

The existence of advanced lifeforms anywhere else in our Solar System
would astonish most scientists but is not completely impossible.  On
the other hand, primitive lifeforms are certainly <b>possible</b> in
several settings, but <b>remote detection is unlikely</b>.  We must
search "in situ," which implies complicated and costly space
missions.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2>F. Intelligent Life Elsewhere</h2>

<h3>Warning</h3>

<ul>

This is a fascinating but virtually <b>100% speculative</b> subject.  There
is a paucity of facts, understanding, and imagination, and that leads
to a wealth of conjecture and controversy.  </p>
</ul>

<h3>The Drake Equation</h3>

<ul>
<a href="im/drake-eq.gif"><em>The Drake Equation</em></a>, named after
astronomer Frank Drake, was an early (1961) "rough order of magnitude"
estimate of the <b>number of advanced technical civilizations</b> in
our Galaxy capable of undertaking <b>interstellar communication</b>.
"Communication" implies the ability to transfer information but not
necessarily to undertake travel between stars.  The most basic form of
communication involves <b>electromagnetic radiation</b>.<?p>

Here is a
simplified list of the elements in the Drake estimate based on our
current understanding: </p>

<ol>

<li> There are <b>100 billion stars</b> in our Galaxy</p>

<li> Assume 0.001% - 5% of the stars have <b>Earth-like planets
in the habitable zone</b>.</p>

<ul> Support?  The recent detection of thousands of extra-solar
planets.  Even though many of these are Neptune-class or larger,
rather than Earth-size, most astronomers expect that the fraction of
stars with Earth-like planets will prove to be of order 5% or larger.
This is at the high end of the range considered plausible over the
last 50 years.</p>

The <a href="guide11.html#kepler">Kepler mission</a> has identified
many planet candidates with sizes near Earth's, most of them slightly
larger.  Some of these are in or near the habitable zones of their
parent stars.  Although the volume of the habitable zones of stars
cooler than the Sun ("K and M dwarf stars") is smaller than ours, such
stars are much more common in the Galaxy than are Sun-like stars, so
these are receiving increased scrutiny.
The <a href="https://tess.gsfc.nasa.gov/">TESS mission</a>, launched
in April 2018, should discover many more planets hosted by small stars
near the Sun.  The latest results are discussed in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstellar_habitable_zone">
this article</a>. </p> 
</ul>

<li> Assume <b>all of those develop life</b> leading to advanced civilizations
(i.e. assume <b>Earth is average</b>)</p>

<ul> Support?  "Earth is average" is the <b>Copernican assumption</b>,
which has proved so <b>successful</b> in studies of the structure of
our inorganic universe on the scale of the Solar System, our Galaxy,
and extragalactic space.  However, there is great controversy about
whether this assumption applies to biology.  We have very little intuition
here, and some biologists would argue that the chances of developing
technological species on a given Earth-like planet are very small.</p>
</ul>

<li> Assume the <b>communication phase</b> lasts 10,000 years.</p> 

<ul>

 Note: we have only recently entered this phase.  It has been only 90
years since we developed commercial radio stations that could be
detected over interplanetary distances.  Our artificially generated
electromagnetic radiation would be the <b>most definitive marker</b>
of advanced lifeforms on this planet to an exernal observer.  Human EM
signals are now propagating out through the Galaxy, with the most
distant signals being about 90 light years away.  </p>

</ul>

<li> Combining all of these factors ===> <b>10 - 10,000 communicating civilizations
in our Galaxy</b></p>

<li> ===>   Distance to nearest: <b>10,000 - 1000 light years</b></p>

</ol>

The quantities entering the Drake calculation under items (3) and (4)
are <b>highly uncertain and controversial</b>.  You can find elaborate
treatments of our understanding of the important factors, and gaps
therein, in the books listed under "optional reading" below.</p>

<ul> One obvious source of bias is the danger of <b>carbon or
planetary chauvinism</b>.  For instance, it has often been suggested that
silicon, which also offers 4 chemical bonds, could be utilized by
lifeforms in place of carbon.  The numbers we used above also 
assume that intelligent life can develop only on terrestrial planets.
But there's no compelling reason that intelligent life
would be confined to planets or even planetary systems.  Why not a
sentient interstellar gas cloud?  This idea was explored in the famous
science fiction
novel <a href="http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/B/BlackCloud.html"
>The Black Cloud</a> by
astronomer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hoyle">Fred
Hoyle</a>.  In the story, the super-being in the
Cloud <a href="extract-TBC.txt">expresses surprise</a> that
intelligence could develop in so adverse an environment as the surface
of a planet.
 </p> </ul>

The bottom line is that, at present, no one can exclude the possibility that
a large number (10,000!) of advanced civilizations reside in our
Galaxy.  The number is large because the Galaxy is <b>huge</b>.</p>

</ul>

<a href="im/sea-of-suns-starship-DDixon-ex.jpg"><img align="right" src="im/sea-of-suns-starship-DDixon-ex.jpg" vspace=10 hspace=10
width=25%></a>


<h3> Interstellar migration/exploration: </h3>

<ul>

The estimated separation between advanced civilizations, 1000-10000
LY, is obviously tremendous.  But it could be traversed
with foreseeable technology on <b>cosmically short time scales</b>.
(Remember that <b>10 million years is a "short time"</b> in the cosmic
context!)  Even at propagation velocities far below the speed of
light, stable civilizations could "rapidly" explore the Galaxy.  </p>

<ul>

Here's a relevant, even amazing, fact:  We <b>human beings managed to
launch four interstellar spacecraft in the first 20 years of the space age!
</b>  The four 
<a href="http://www.heavens-above.com/SolarEscape.aspx?lat=0&lng=0&loc=Unspecified&alt=0&tz=CET">Pioneer
and Voyager spacecraft</a>, sent to study the Jovian planets, will
all leave the Solar System, as will the New Horizons Pluto mission. </p>

<ul>
The most distant manmade object, the Voyager 1 spacecraft, is now <b>11.6
billion miles</b> (125 Astronomical Units) from Earth and officially
entered interstellar space in September 2013. </p>

</ul>
There is a <a href="http://www.centauri-dreams.org/">growing community</a>
of scientists and engineers making preliminary plans for interstellar
travel.  Above right is a painting of a popular starship design, a
"Bussard interstellar ramjet." </p>

</ul>
</ul>

<b><font color="blue">The Fermi "Paradox"</font></b></p>

<ul>

A famous question, now called the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">Fermi
Paradox</a> because it was first raised by physicist Enrico Fermi in
the 1950's, is therefore  "<b>Where is everybody?</b>" </p>
<ul>

What Fermi meant was that if interstellar expansion is possible for
thousands of Galactic species, they should have reached here long ago.
There ought to be aliens cluttering up the Solar System.  We don't see
them -- there is no credible evidence for alien visitation (see
below) -- so are the estimates for the number of advanced
civilizations and our expectations regarding interstellar travel badly
wrong or naive?</p>

Entire books have been written on possible solutions (all sheer
speculation) to the problems raised by Fermi's question.  I give my
favorite answer below.</p>

</ul>
</ul>

<h3> SETI = "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence"</h3>

<ul>

The best alternative to interstellar travel to assay the prevalence of
life in the nearby universe would be <b>EM communication</b>, probably
in the radio or optical EM bands </p>

Several <a href="im/contact1.jpg" >passive listening,</a> radio search
programs are ongoing.  Most sophisticated are those operated by
the <a href="http://www.seti.org/" >SETI Institute</a>, once a
well-financed NASA program but killed by Congressional scepticism and
now running on private contributions. </p>

When SETI programs were first conceived 50 years ago, it was assumed
that we might most easily detect <b>"leakage" radiation</b> from
civilizations employing radio- or TV-like broadcasting for
communication.  But we ourselves have backed away from radio/TV
broadcasts, and today orders of magnitude more information is being
conveyed over cable and fiber optic systems that don't radiate
significantly.  Therefore, if we do detect ETI through EM
communications, it is more likely to be in the form of 
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20624057/"><b>beacons</b></a>
deliberately established to attract attention rather than "leakage."
These are also likely to be products of the most successful and
advanced of (possibly) many Galactic civilizations. </p>

</ul>

<p><br></p>

<h2>G. Alien Artifacts?</h2>

Most people assume that if spacefaring aliens are active today in the
vicinity of the Earth, or had arrived anytime over the last few 100
million years, there should be concrete evidence of that visitation -- 
<a href="im/2001-tycho01.jpg" ><b>artifacts</b></a> <b>of
extraterrestrial intelligence</b>.  In fact, you can find many
gigabytes on the Internet devoted to claims that there is "good"
evidence for visitations. But, so far, these have not stood up under
scrutiny.  </p>

Here are two prominent examples of a supposed alien presence in the Solar
System:</p>

<ul>

<li><font color="blue"><b>UFO's</b></font> </p>

<ul>
See <a href="guide18.html">Guide 18</a> and links therein.  There is
no credible evidence that an intelligent species (other than our own)
is involved in the "Unidentified Flying Object" phenomenon.  An
overwhelmingly strong <a href="im/x-files-mulder-scully.jpg"> media
influence</a> governs the number and similarity of reports.  Publicity
can even provoke mild mass hysteria (e.g. alien abduction
claims).  </p>
</ul>

<li> <font color="blue"><b>The face on Mars</b></font> </p>

<ul>

This is a strange and interesting feature in the 
<a href="im/cydonia-region-big-MarsExp-06.jpg">
Cydonia region of Mars</a> that was imaged (poorly) by the Viking
spacecraft in the 1970's.  In a partially-illuminated state, it looked
like a gigantic, carved human head.  One of the original Viking images
is shown below (left panel).  This elicited speculation about
civilizations on Mars, the more responsible of which can be sampled
<a href="http://www.enterprisemission.com/mcdaniel.html">here</a>.</p>


<!-- GONE! 4/04
the more responsible of which can be sampled <a
href="http://www.mcdanielreport.com" >
 -->

In April 1998, the <a href="http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/"
> Mars Global Surveyor</a> was retargeted to image the same region at
much higher resolution.
Several <a "http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/msss/camera/images/4_6_face_release/index.html"
> good images</a> were returned, showing the fully illuminated "face"
to be an <b>unambiguously natural</b> feature.  See the right panel
below. (Some of the intriguing features in the original image, like
the "headdress," were actually data drop-outs.)  Yet
<a href="im/face-big-MarsExp-06.jpg">better images</a> have been
more recently obtained by the Mars Express orbiter.  No other candidates
for alien artifacts on Mars or other planets are credible either.</p>

You can find trenchant commentary by Phil Plait (the "Bad Astronomer")
about the (needless) continuing controversy over this subject
<a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/hoagland/index.html"
>here</a>. </p>

</ul>

Astronomers have also considered the possibility of detecting alien
artifacts <b>other than deliberate signals</b> beyond the Solar
System.  For instance, an advanced civilization might have created a
<b>mega-structure</b> to capture a large fraction of the energy output of
their host star.  Such a structure is called
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere">Dyson
Sphere</a>, and its presence could be indicated by an unusual
near-infrared flux excess not typical of normal stars.  Deliberate
searches among databases from infrared sky surveys have not yet turned
up any viable candidates.</p>

However, in 2015, a fascinating candidate for a Dyson-like structure
emerged from the <a href="guide11.html#kepler">Kepler Mission
exoplanet survey</a>:</p>

<ul>

<li><font color="blue"><b>Tabby Boyajian's Star</b></font></p>

Tabby's Star is an outwardly inconspicuous star in the large Kepler
survey field.  It shows a 
<a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/tabbys-star-weird-star-gets-weirder/">
strange, non-repeating pattern of eclipses</a> some of them much too
large to be from planet-sized bodies.  The star has received intense
scrutiny, and it has recently been discovered to be declining slowly
in (uneclipsed) brightness in a way that normal stars do not. </p>

It is very unlikely that an alien mega-structure is responsible for
the weird properties of Tabby's Star, but it must be admitted
that none of the more conventional explanations (e.g. debris
from a planetary collision or a swarm of comets) explain
the observations either.  So far, the star is an astronomical
mystery. </p>

</ul>

<!-- There is a nice, full article on Tabby's Star in the June 2017
issue of Sky and Telescope, but it's behind a paywall.  -->

Evidence of alien technology, whether in the form of a communication
signal or an artifact, would now be called a <b><em>technosignature</em></b>,
and a 2018
<a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1812/1812.08681.pdf">NASA
conference</a> reviewed the status of work in this area.</p>


<p><br></p>

<h2>H. The Recognition Chasm</h2>

There is a <b>much more fundamental</b> problem in communicating with
alien civilizations than their <b>distance</b> from us.  It presents
major obstacles to even <b>recognizing</b> them in the first place.
</p>

<ul>

<li>  The mean <b>age difference</b> between two 
Galactic species is likely to be <b>100's of millions of years</b>.</p>


<li> Given favorable conditions, successful advanced lifeforms may
have <b>continued evolution</b> and intellectual/technical development
for a large fraction of that time.  (Once they reach a certain level
of development, they become immune to the more serious astronomical
hazards for lifeforms, such as asteroid impacts and stellar
evolution.)</p>


<li> The <b>age separation is much more important</b> than the
spatial separation </p>

<ul><ul>

  ====>  <b>us : them  ~ goldfish : us </b></p>

</ul></ul>

<li> Since recognition and communication is possible only for
cultures in close intellectual proximity,</p>

<ul>

====>  <b><em>Aliens would appear to be natural
phenomena</em></b>.</p>

So, my favorite answer to Fermi's question, "Where is everybody?"
is:</p>

 <b>"They're here, but we don't recognize them."</b></p>

</ul>
</ul>


<p><br></p>
<h2>I.  Epilogue</h2>

<ul>A quote from Stanley Kubrick, director of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)"><em>"2001 -- A Space
Ddyssey,"</em></a> on the possibilities for advanced lifeforms in the
universe: </p>
</ul>


<center>
<table width=75%>
<tr><td>
<font size="+1" color="green"><b><em>

"Now, the Sun is by no means an old star, and its planets are mere
  children in cosmic age, so it seems likely that there are billions
  of planets in the universe not only where intelligent life is on a
  lower scale than man but other billions where it is approximately
  equal and others still where it is hundreds or thousands of millions
  of years in advance of us. When you think of the giant technological
  strides that man has made in a few millennia -- less than a microsecond
  in the chronology of the universe -- can you imagine the evolutionary
  development that much older life forms have taken?  They may have
  progressed from biological species, which are fragile shells for the
  mind at best, into immortal machine entities -— and then, over
  innumerable eons, they could emerge from the chrysalis of matter
  transformed into beings of pure energy and spirit. Their
  potentialities would be limitless and their intelligence ungraspable
  by humans."
