<H1>A Field Guide to Critical Thinking</H1>

ALIGN=right>

There are many reasons for the popularity of paranormal beliefs in the
United States today, including:

<OL>
  <LI> the irresponsibility of the mass media, who exploit the public
       taste for nonsense,
  <LI> the irrationality of the American world-view, which supports
       such unsupportable claims as ghosts and the efficacy
       of the polygraph, and
  <LI> the ineffectiveness of public education, which generally fails
       to teach students the essential skills of critical thinking.
</OL>

As a college professor, I am especially concerned with this third
problem. Most of the freshman and sophomore students in my classes
simply do not know how to draw reasonable conclusions from the
evidence. At most, they've been taught in high school what to think;
few of them know how to think.<P>

In an attempt to remedy this problem at my college, I've developed an
elective course called "Anthropology and the Paranormal." The course
examines the complete range of paranormal beliefs in contemporary
American culture, from precognition and psychokinesis to channeling
and cryptozoology and everything between and beyond, including
astrology, UFOs, and creationism. I teach the students very little
about anthropological theories and even less about anthropological
terminology. Instead, I try to communicate the essence of the
anthropological perspective, by teaching them, indirectly, what the
scientific method is all about. I do so by teaching them how to
evaluate evidence. I give them six simple rules to follow when
considering any claim, and then show them how to apply those six rules
to the examination of any paranormal claim.<P>

The six rules of evidential reasoning are my own distillation and
simplification of the scientific method. To make it easier for
students to remember these half-dozen guidelines, I've coined an
acronym for them: Ignoring the vowels, the letters in the word
"<STRONG>FiLCHeRS</STRONG>" stand for the rules of Falsifiability,
Logic, Comprehensiveness, Honesty, Replicability, and
Sufficiency. Apply these six rules to the evidence offered for any
claim, I tell my students, and no one will ever be able to sneak up on
you and steal your belief. You'll be filch-proof.<P>

<H2>Falsifiability</H2>

<STRONG>It must be possible to conceive of evidence that would prove
the claim false.</STRONG><P>

It may sound paradoxical, but in order for any claim to be true, it
must be falsifiable. The rule of falsifiability is a guarantee that if
the claim is false, the evidence will prove it false; and if the claim
is true, the evidence will not disprove it (in which case the claim
can be tentatively accepted as true until such time as evidence is
brought forth that does disprove it). The rule of falsifiability, in
short, says that the evidence must matter, and as such it is the first
and most important and most fundamental rule of evidential reasoning.<P>

The rule of falsifiability is essential for this reason: If nothing
conceivable could ever disprove the claim, then the evidence that does
exist would not matter; it would be pointless to even examine the
evidence, because the conclusion is already known -- the claim is
invulnerable to any possible evidence. This would not mean, however,
that the claim is true; instead it would mean that the claim is
meaningless. This is so because it is impossible -- logically
impossible -- for any claim to be true no matter what. For every true
claim, you can always conceive of evidence that would make the claim
untrue -- in other words, again, every true claim is falsifiable.<P>

For example, the true claim that the life span of human beings is less
than 200 years is falsifiable; it would be falsified if a single human
being were to live to be 200 years old. Similarly, the true claim that
water freezes at 32&deg; F is falsifiable; it would be falsified if
water were to freeze at, say, 34&deg; F. Each of these claims is firmly
established as scientific "fact," and we do not expect either claim
ever to be falsified; however, the point is that either could be. Any
claim that could not be falsified would be devoid of any propositional
content; that is, it would not be making a factual assertion -- it
would instead be making an emotive statement, a declaration of the way
the claimant feels about the world. Nonfalsifiable claims do
communicate information, but what they describe is the claimant's
value orientation. They communicate nothing whatsoever of a factual
nature, and hence are neither true nor false. Nonfalsifiable
statements are propositionally vacuous.<P>

There are two principal ways in which the rule of falsifiability can
be violated -- two ways, in other words, of making nonfalsifiable
claims. The first variety of nonfalsifiable statements is the
undeclared claim: a statement that is so broad or vague that it lacks
any propositional content. The undeclared claim is basically
unintelligible and consequently meaningless. Consider, for example,
the claim that crystal therapists can use pieces of quartz to restore
balance and harmony to a person's spiritual energy. What does it mean
to have unbalanced spiritual energy? How is the condition recognized
and diagnosed? What evidence would prove that someone's unbalanced
spiritual energy had been -- or had not been -- balanced by the
application of crystal therapy? Most New Age wonders, in fact, consist
of similarly undeclared claims that dissolve completely when exposed
to the solvent of rationality.<P>

The undeclared claim has the advantage that virtually any evidence
that could be adduced could be interpreted as congruent with the
claim, and for that reason it is especially popular among
paranormalists who claim precognitive powers. Jeane Dixon, for
example, predicted that 1987 would be a year "filled with changes" for
Caroline Kennedy. Dixon also predicted that Jack Kemp would "face
major disagreements with the rest of his party" in 1987 and that
"world-wide drug terror" would be "unleashed by narcotics czars" in
the same year. She further revealed that Dan Rather "may [or may not]
be hospitalized" in 1988, and that Whitney Houston's "greatest
problem" in 1986 would be "balancing her personal life against her
career." The undeclared claim boils down to a statement that can be
translated as "Whatever will be, will be."<P>

The second variety of nonfalsifiable statements, which is even more
popular among paranormalists, involves the use of the multiple out,
that is, an inexhaustible series of excuses intended to explain away
the evidence that would seem to falsify the claim. Creationists, for
example, claim that the universe is no more than 10,000 years
old. They do so despite the fact that we can observe stars that are
billions of light-years from the earth, which means that the light
must have left those stars billions of years ago, and which proves
that the universe must be billions of years old. How then do the
creationists respond to this falsification of their claim? By
suggesting that God must have created the light already on the way
from those distant star at the moment of creation 10,000 years ago. No
conceivable piece of evidence, of course, could disprove that
claim.<P>

Additional examples of multiple outs abound in the realm of the paranormal. UFO
proponents, faced with a lack of reliable physical or photographic evidence to
buttress the claims, point to a secret "government conspiracy" that is
allegedly preventing the release of evidence that would support their
case. Psychic healers say they can heal you if you have enough faith in their
psychic powers. Psychokinetics say they can bend spoons with their minds if
they are not exposed to negative vibrations from skeptic observers. Tarot
readers can predict your fate if you're sincere in your desire for
knowledge. The multiple out means, in effect, "Heads I win, tails you lose."

<H2>Logic</H2>

<STRONG>Any argument offered as evidence in support of any claim must
be sound.</STRONG><P>

An argument is said to be "valid" if its conclusion follows unavoidably
from its premises; it is "sound" if it is valid and if all the
premises are true. The rule of logic thus governs the validity of
inference. Although philosophers have codified and named the various
forms of valid arguments, it is not necessary to master a course in
form logic in order to apply the rules of inference consistently and
correctly An invalid argument can be recognize by the simple method of
counterexample: If you can conceive of a single imaginable instance
whereby the conclusion would not necessarily follow from the premises
even if the premises were true, then the argument is invalid. Consider
the following syllogism for example: All dogs have fleas; Xavier has
fleas; therefore Xavier is a dog. That argument is invalid because a
single flea-ridden feline named Xavier would provide an effective
counterexample. If an argument is invalid, then it is, by definition,
unsound. Not all valid arguments are sound, however. Consider this
example: All dogs have fleas; Xavier is a dog; therefore Xavier has
fleas. That argument is unsound, even though it is valid, because the
first premise is false: All dogs do not have fleas.<P>

To determine whether a valid argument is sound is frequently
problematic; knowing whether a given premise is true or false often
demands additional knowledge about the claim that may require
empirical investigation. If the argument passes these two tests,
however -- if it is both valid and sound -- then the conclusion can be
embraced with certainty.<P>

The rule of logic is frequently violated by pseudoscientists. Erich
von D&auml;niken, who singlehandedly popularized the ancient-astronaut
mythology in the 1970s, wrote many books in which he offered invalid
and unsound arguments with benumbing regularity (see Omohundro
1976). In <CITE>Chariots of the Gods?</CITE> he was not above making
arguments that were both logically invalid and factually inaccurate --
in other words, arguments that were doubly unsound. For example, von
D&auml;niken argues that the map of the world made by the
sixteenth-century Turkish admiral Piri Re'is is so "astoundingly
accurate" that it could only have been made from satellite
photographs. Not only is the argument invalid (any number of
imaginable techniques other than satellite photography could result in
an "astoundingly accurate" map), but the premise is simply wrong --
the Piri Re'is map, in fact, contains many gross inaccuracies (see
Story 1981).

<H2>Comprehensiveness</H2>

<STRONG>The evidence offered in support of any claim must be
exhaustive -- that is all of the available evidence must be
considered.</STRONG><P>

For obvious reasons, it is never reasonable to consider only the
evidence that supports a theory and to discard the evidence that
contradicts it. This rule is straightforward and self-apparent, and it
requires little explication or justification. Nevertheless, it is a
rule that is frequently broken by proponents of paranormal claims and
by those who adhere to paranormal beliefs.<P>

For example, the proponents of biorhythm theory are fond of pointing
to airplane crashes that occurred on days when the pilot, copilot,
anchor navigator were experiencing critically low points in their
intellectual, emotional, and/or physical cycles. The evidence
considered by the biorhythm apologists, however, does not include the
even larger number of airplane crashes that occurred when the crews
were experiencing high or neutral points in their biorhythm cycles
(Hines 1988:160). Similarly, when people believe that Jeane Dixon has
precognitive ability because she predicted the 1988 election of George
Bush (which she did, two months before the election, when every social
scientist, media maven, and private citizen in the country was making
the same prognostication), they typically ignore the thousands of
forecasts that Dixon has made that have failed to come true (such as
her predictions that John F. Kennedy would not win the presidency in
1960, that World War III would begin in 1958, and that Fidel Castro
would die in 1969). If you are willing to be selective in the evidence
you consider, you could reasonably conclude that the earth is flat.<P>

<H2>Honesty</H2>

<STRONG>The evidence offered in support of any claim must be evaluated
without self-deception.</STRONG><P>

The rule of honesty is a corollary to the rule of
comprehensiveness. When you have examined all of the evidence, it is
essential that you be honest with yourself about the results of that
examination. If the weight of the evidence contradicts the claim, then
you are required to abandon belief in that claim. The obverse, of
course, would hold as well.<P>

The rule of honesty, like the rule of comprehensiveness, is frequently
violated by both proponents and adherents of paranormal
beliefs. Parapsychologists violate this rule when they conclude, after
numerous subsequent experiments have failed to replicate initially
positive psi results, that psi must be an elusive
phenomenon. (Applying Occam's Razor, the more honest conclusion would
be that the original positive result must have been a coincidence.)
Believers in the paranormal violate this rule when they conclude,
after observing a "psychic" surreptitiously bend a spoon with his
hands, that he only cheats sometimes.<P>

In practice, the rule of honesty usually boils down to an injunction
against breaking the rule of falsifiability by taking a multiple
out. There is more to it than that, however: The rule of honesty means
that you must accept the obligation to come to a rational conclusion
once you have examined all the evidence. If the overwhelming weight of
all the evidence falsifies your belief, then you must conclude that
the belief is false, and you must face the implications of that
conclusion forthrightly. In the face of overwhelmingly negative
evidence, neutrality and agnosticism are no better than credulity and
faith. Denial, avoidance, rationalization, and all the other familiar
mechanisms of self-deception would constitute violations of the rule
of honesty.<P>

In my view, this rule alone would all but invalidate the entire
discipline of parapsychology. After more than a century of systematic,
scholarly research, the psi hypothesis remains wholly unsubstantiated
and unsupportable; parapsychologists have failed, as Ray Hyman
(1985:7) observes, to produce "any consistent evidence for
paranormality that can withstand acceptable scientific scrutiny." From
all indications, the number of parapsychologists who observe the rule
of honesty pales in comparison with the number who delude
themselves. Veteran psychic investigator Eric Dingwall (1985:162)
summed up his extensive experience in parapsychological research with
this observation: "After sixty years' experience and personal
acquaintance with most of the leading parapsychologists of that period
I do not think I could name a half dozen whom I could call objective
student who honestly wished to discover the truth."<P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="gifs/critical-thinking.gif" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=290 ALT=""></CENTER>

<H2>Replicability</H2>

<STRONG>If the evidence for any claim is based upon an experimental
result, or if the evidence offered in support of any claim could
logically be explained as coincidental, then it is necessary for the
evidence to be repeated in subsequent experiments or
trials.</STRONG><P>

The rule of replicability provides a safeguard against the possibility
of error, fraud, or coincidence. A single experimental result is never
adequate in and of itself, whether the experiment concerns the
production of nuclear fusion or the existence of telepathic
ability. Any experiment, no matter how carefully designed and
executed, is always subject to the possibility of implicit bias or
undetected error. The rule of replicability, which requires
independent observers to follow the same procedures and to achieve the
same results, is an effective way of correcting bias or error, even if
the bias or error remains permanently unrecognized. If the
experimental results are the product of deliberate fraud, the rule of
replicability will ensure that the experiment will eventually be
performed by honest researchers.<P>

If the phenomenon in question could conceivably be the product of
coincidence, then the phenomenon must be replicated before the
hypothesis of coincidence can be rejected. If coincidence is in fact
the explanation for the phenomenon, then the phenomenon will not be
duplicated in subsequent trials, and the hypothesis of coincidence
will be confirmed; but if coincidence is not the explanation, then the
phenomenon may be duplicated, and an explanation other than
coincidence will have to be sought. If I correctly predict the next
roll of the dice, you should demand that I duplicate the feat before
granting that my prediction was anything but a coincidence.<P>

The rule of replicability is regularly violated by parapsychologists,
who are especially fond of misinterpreting coincidences. The famous
"psychic sleuths Gerard Croiset, for example, allegedly solved
numerous baffling crimes and located hundreds of missing persons in a
career that spanned five decades, from the 1940s until his death in
1980. The truth is that the overwhelming majority of Croiset's
predictions were either vague and nonfalsifiable or simply
wrong. Given the fact that Croiset made thousands of predictions
during his lifetime, it is hardly surprising that he enjoyed one or
two chance "hits." The late Dutch parapsychologist Wilhelm Tenhaeff,
however, seized upon those "very few prize cases" to argue that
Croiset possessed demonstrated psi powers (Hoebens 1986a:130). That
was a clear violation of the rule of replicability, and could not have
been taken as evidence of Croiset's psi abilities even if the "few
prize cases" had been true. (In fact, however, much of Tenhaeff's data
was fraudulent -- see Hoebens 1986b. )<P>

<H2>Sufficiency</H2>

<STRONG>The evidence offered in support of any claim must be adequate
to establish the truth of that claim, with these stipulations:

<OL>
  <LI> the burden of proof for any claim rests on the claimant,
  <LI> extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence, and
  <LI> evidence based upon authority and/or testimony is always
       inadequate for any paranormal claim
</OL>
</STRONG>
<P>

The burden of proof always rests with the claimant for the simple
reason that the absence of disconfirming evidence is not the same as
the presence of confirming evidence. This rule is frequently violated
by proponents of paranormal claims, who argue that, because their
claims have not been disproved, they have therefore been proved. (UFO
buffs, for example, argue that because skeptics have not explained
every UFO sighting, some UFO sightings must be extraterrestrial
spacecraft.) Consider the implications of that kind of reasoning: If I
claim that Adolf Hitler is alive and well and living in Argentina, how
could you disprove my claim? Since the claim is logically possible,
the best you could do (in the absence of unambiguous forensic
evidence) is to show that the claim is highly improbable -- but that
would not disprove it. The fact that you cannot prove that Hitler is
not living in Argentina, however, does not mean that I have proved
that he is. It only means that I have proved that he could be -- but
that would mean very little; logical possibility is not the same as
established reality. If the absence of disconfirming evidence were
sufficient proof of a claim, then we could "prove" anything that we
could imagine. Belief must be based not simply on the absence of
disconfirming evidence but on the presence of confirming evidence. It
is the claimant's obligation to furnish that confirming evidence.<P>

Extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence for the obvious
reason of balance. If I claim that it rained for ten minutes on my way
to work last Tuesday, you would be justified in accepting that claim
as true on the basis of my report. But if I claim that I was abducted
by extraterrestrial aliens who whisked me to the far side of the moon
and performed bizarre medical experiments on me, you would be
justified in demanding more substantial evidence. The ordinary
evidence of my testimony, while sufficient for ordinary claims, is not
sufficient for extraordinary ones.<P>

In fact, testimony is always inadequate for any paranormal claim, whether it is
offered by an authority or a layperson, for the simple reason that a human
being can lie or make a mistake. No amount of expertise in any field is a
guarantee against human fallibility, and expertise does not preclude the
motivation to lie; therefore a person's credentials, knowledge and experience
cannot, in themselves be taken as sufficient evidence to establish the truth of
a claim. Moreover, a person's sincerity lends nothing to the credibility of his
or her testimony. Even if people are telling what they sincerely believe to be
the truth, it is always possible that they could be mistaken. Perception is a
selective act, dependent upon belief context, expectation, emotional and
biochemical states, and a host of other variables. Memory is notoriously
problematic, prone to a range of distortions, deletions, substitutions and
amplifications. Therefore the testimony that people offer of what they remember
seeing or hearing should always be regarded as only provisionally and
approximately accurate; when people are speaking about the paranormal, their
testimony should never be regarded as reliable evidence in and of itself. The
possibility and even the likelihood of error are far too extensive (see Connor
1986) .<P>

<H2>Conclusion</H2>

The first three rules of FiLCHeRS -- falsifiability, logic, and
comprehensiveness -- are all logically necessary rules of evidential
reasoning. If we are to have confidence in the veracity of any claim
whether normal or paranormal, the claim must be prepositionally
meaningful, and the evidence offered in support of the claim must be
rational and exhaustive.<P>

The last three rules of FiLCHeRS -- honesty, replicability, and
sufficiency -- are all pragmatically necessary rules of evidential
reasoning. Because human beings are often motivated to rationalize and
to lie to themselves, because they are sometimes motivated to lie to
others, because they can make mistakes, and because perception and
memory are problematic, we must demand that the evidence for any
factual claim be evaluated without self-deception, that it be
carefully screened for error, fraud, and appropriateness, and that it
be substantial and unequivocal.<P>

What I tell my students, then, is that you can and should use FiLCHeRS
to evaluate the evidence offered for any claim. If the claim fails any
one of these six tests, then it should be rejected; but if it passes
all six tests, then you are justified in placing considerable
confidence in it.<P>

Passing all six tests, of course, does not guarantee that the claim is
true (just because you have examined all the evidence available today
is no guarantee that there will not be new and disconfirming evidence
available tomorrow), but it does guarantee that you have good reasons
for believing the claim. It guarantees that you have sold your belief
for a fair price, and that it has not been filched from you.<P>

Being a responsible adult means accepting the fact that almost all knowledge is
tentative, and accepting it cheerfully. You may be required to change your
belief tomorrow, if the evidence warrants, and you should be willing and able
to do so. That, in essence, is what skepticism means: to believe if and only if
the evidence warrants.<P>
