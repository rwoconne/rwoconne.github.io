              <p align="CENTER"><b><font size="4">NEW NASA OFFICE TO FOCUS ON 
                ASTEROID DETECTION</font></b> </p>
              <p align="CENTER">by Leonard David, in Space News (April 6-12, 1998)</p>
              <p>Asteroids and comets will get increased attention at NASA as 
                a new program office is formed to coordinate data from spacecraft 
                and ground-based observations of celestial bodies. This office 
                will help avoid a repeat of the media frenzy surrounding the early 
                March announcement that Earth might be on the receiving end of 
                an asteroid in 2028, a possibility later retracted. The new office 
                will increase financial support for the detection and characterization 
                of Near Earth Objects (NEOs). It will work with other groups in 
                the United States and abroad to create an inventory of NEOs. One 
                of its goals will be to identify asteroids at sizes down to 1 
                km in diameter. Scientists estimate that 2000 Earth-crossing asteroids 
                at least a kilometer in size have yet to be identified.</p>
              <p>The yet-to-be-named program office will be located at a NASA 
                field center within the next few weeks, though some responsibilities 
                will be maintained at NASA Headquarters in Washington, said Tom 
                Morgan, discipline scientist for planetary astronomy. Morgan is 
                shaping the duties of the new office.</p>
              <p>&quot;The first job is to understand what is out there, increase 
                the numbers of detections and get good orbits for them,&quot; 
                Morgan told Space News March 27. He said the new office will strengthen 
                NASA&#146;s ground-based program and study data from spacecraft 
                missions to asteroids and comets.</p>
              <p>Some $3 million is now being earmarked for the new program, a 
                doubling of current NASA funding NEO work, he said. . . . </p>
              <p>&quot;Part of our ongoing plan is to understand the composition, 
                the mineralogy, the physical condition of increasing numbers of 
                NEOs,&quot; Morgan said. . . . </p>
              <p>David Morrison, director of space for NASA Ames Research Center 
                at Moffett Field, Calif., said the recent public interest in asteroid 
                1997 XF11 shows the general concern about impact dangers and indicates 
                potential public support for efforts to protect the planet. Morrison 
                said an asteroid the size of XF11 striking Earth would release 
                a million megatons of energy, probably leading to the death of 
                millions of people. &quot;The first step has to be to search for 
                threatening objects. If we don&#146;t look, we can be taken entirely 
                by surprise,: Morrison said March 26.</p>

              <p>Many questions remain to be answered. . . Can we develop the 
                scientific base of information necessary to save the Earth from 
                an incoming asteroid like the one we believe ended the epoch of 
                the dinosaurs 65 million years ago? . . .</p>

              <p>Congressman Weldon asked about NASA's asteroid study. Mr. Goldin 
                described a series of missions tracking these small bodies in 
                cooperation with the Department of Defense. A new NASA Program 
                Office is being put together which would integrate all of the 
                NASA programs and research which is being done involving near-earth-crossing 
                objects to study potential collisions with Earth and evasive actions

              <p align="CENTER">Boston Globe, April 6, 1998</p>
              <p align="CENTER">By David L. Chandler</p>
              <p>. . . Boosted by all the public attention generated by the [XF11] 
                affair -</p>
              <p> and perhaps by the imminent arrival of two Hollywood blockbusters 
                about asteroid impacts - the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
                decided last week to double its spending this year on efforts 
                to track down most of the rocks hurtling through space that might 
                have Earth's name on them.</p>
              <p>. . . Because of the way the [XF11] episode played out, [Carl] 
                Pilcher</p>
              <p>said, NASA last week drafted preliminary guidelines for any future 
                reports of threatening asteroids. The plan, drafted after a long 
                and heated meeting among the specialists last month in Houston, 
                in essence calls for private consultation among the groups involved 
                before any public announcement is made.</p>
              <p>''I think the obligation we have as a community is to provide 
                the best possible information about whatever is out there, in 
                the shortest possible time,'' said Pilcher, NASA's acting science 
                director for solar system exploration. With 1997 XF11, that ''best 
                information'' was compiled the day after the initial announcement. 
                . . . ''We have the goal in our strategic plan to identify all 
                the objects greater than 1 kilometer in diameter'' - those large 
                enough to be capable of producing global damage if they were to 
                strike Earth - ''and do that in a decade. That is our objective.'' 
                But that will require a significant increase over the present 
                efforts, which are finding ''potentially hazardous asteroids'' 
                at a rate of about one a month.</p>

              <p>1. No hazard or threat prediction statements will be released 
                without verification and consensus.</p>
              <p>2. Astrometric data on Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) or suspected 
                NEOs received by the Minor Planets Center (MPC) of the International 
                Astronomical Union at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics 
                will be made available to the scientific community, generally 
                within 24 hours of receipt.</p>
              <p>3. Should a member of the NEO search community2 note a future, 
                possibly threatening, close approach to the Earth, the other members 
                of the NEO search community will be notified so that calculations 
                can be checked and archival files can be searched for prediscovery 
                observations. The response will be coordinated by a point of contact 
                to be designated by the NASA Office of Space Science (OSS), and 
                the search community will make an effort to reach consensus as 
                to the nature of the threat within 48 hours of being informed.</p>
              <p>4. The NASA OSS will be informed at least 24 hours in advance 
                of any public report of a PHO.</p>
              <p>5. NASA, in coordination with appropriate national and international 
                organizations, will sponsor a study of how best to communicate 
                NEO issues to the public. This study will include an international 
                workshop to develop detailed recommendations concerning procedures, 
                roles, and responsibilities regarding observations, orbit calculations, 
                and</p>
              <p>communications with the public and policy-making officials.</p>
