<p>Astronomers at the Space Telescope Science Institute today unveiled
the deepest portrait of the visible universe ever achieved by 
humankind. Called the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), the 
million-second-long exposure reveals the first galaxies to emerge 
from the so-called "dark ages," the time shortly after the big bang 
when the first stars reheated the cold, dark universe. The new 
image should offer new insights into what types of objects 
reheated the universe long ago. </p>
<p>This historic new view is actually two separate images taken by 
Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and the Near Infrared 
Camera and Multi-object Spectrometer (NICMOS). Both images reveal 
galaxies that are too faint to be seen by ground-based telescopes, 
or even in Hubble's previous faraway looks, called the Hubble Deep 
Fields (HDFs), taken in 1995 and 1998.</p>
<p>"Hubble takes us to within a stone's throw of the big bang itself,"
says Massimo Stiavelli of the Space Telescope Science Institute in 
Baltimore, Md., and the HUDF project lead. The combination of ACS and 
NICMOS images will be used to search for galaxies that existed between 
400 and 800 million years (corresponding to a redshift range of 7 to 12)
after the big bang. A key question for HUDF astronomers is whether the 
universe appears to be the same at this very early time as it did when 
the cosmos was between 1 and 2 billion years old. </p>
<p>The HUDF field contains an estimated 10,000 galaxies. In ground-based 
images, the patch of sky in which the galaxies reside (just one-tenth 
the diameter of the full Moon) is largely empty. Located in the 
constellation Fornax, the region is below the constellation Orion. </p>
<p>The final ACS image, assembled by Anton Koekemoer of the Space Telescope 
Science Institute, is studded with a wide range of galaxies of various 
sizes, shapes, and colors. In vibrant contrast to the image's rich 
harvest of classic spiral and elliptical galaxies, there is a zoo of 
oddball galaxies littering the field. Some look like toothpicks; others 
like links on a bracelet. A few appear to be interacting. Their strange
shapes are a far cry from the majestic spiral and elliptical galaxies
we see today. These oddball galaxies chronicle a period when the
universe was more chaotic. Order and structure were just beginning to
emerge.</p>
<p>Installed in 2002 during the last servicing mission to the Hubble 
telescope, the ACS has twice the field of view and a higher sensitivity 
than the older workhorse camera, the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2, 
installed during the 1993 servicing mission. "The large discovery 
efficiency of the ACS is now being exploited in sky surveys such as the 
HUDF," Stiavelli says. </p>
<p>The NICMOS sees even farther than the ACS. The NICMOS reveals the 
farthest galaxies ever seen, because the expanding universe has stretched 
their light into the near-infrared portion of the spectrum. "The NICMOS 
provides important additional scientific content to cosmological studies 
in the HUDF," says Rodger Thompson of the University of Arizona and the 
NICMOS Principal Investigator. The ACS uncovered galaxies that existed 
800 million years after the big bang (at a redshift of 7). But the 
NICMOS may have spotted galaxies that lived just 400 million years after 
the birth of the cosmos (at a redshift of 12). Thompson must confirm the 
NICMOS discovery with follow-up research. </p>
<p>"The images will also help us prepare for the next step from NICMOS on 
the Hubble telescope to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)," Thompson 
explains. "The NICMOS images reach back to the distance and time that 
JWST is destined to explore at much greater sensitivity." In addition to 
distant galaxies, the longer infrared wavelengths are sensitive to 
galaxies that are intrinsically red, such as elliptical galaxies and 
galaxies that have red colors due to a high degree of dust absorption. </p>
<p>The entire HUDF also was observed with the advanced camera's "grism" 
spectrograph, a hybrid prism and diffraction grating. "The grism spectra 
have already yielded the identification of about a thousand objects. 
Included among them are some of the intensely faint and red points of 
light in the ACS image, prime candidates for distant galaxies," says 
Sangeeta Malhotra of the Space Telescope Science Institute and the 
Principal Investigator for the Ultra Deep Field's ACS grism follow-up 
study. "Based on those identifications, some of these objects are among 
the farthest and youngest galaxies ever seen. The grism spectra also 
distinguish among other types of very red objects, such as old and dusty 
red galaxies, quasars, and cool dwarf stars." </p>
<p>Galaxies evolved so quickly in the universe that their most important 
changes happened within a billion years of the big bang. "Where the HDFs 
showed galaxies when they were youngsters, the HUDF reveals them as 
toddlers, enmeshed in a period of rapid developmental changes," Stiavelli 
says. </p>
<p>Hubble's ACS allows astronomers to see galaxies two to four times fainter 
than Hubble could view previously, and is also very sensitive to the 
near-infrared radiation that allows astronomers to pluck out some of the 
farthest observable galaxies in the universe. This will hold the record 
as the deepest-ever view of the universe until ESA, together with NASA, 
launches the James Webb Space Telescope in 2011. </p>
<p>Though ground-based telescopes have, to date, spied objects that existed 
just 500 million years after the big bang (at a redshift of 10), they 
need the help of a rare natural zoom lens in space, called a gravitational 
lens, to see them. However, the ACS can reveal typical galaxies at these 
great distances. Even much larger ground-based telescopes with adaptive 
optics cannot reproduce such a view. The ACS picture required a series 
of exposures taken over the course of 400 Hubble orbits around Earth. 
This is such a big chunk of the telescope's annual observing time that 
Institute Director Steven Beckwith used his own Director's Discretionary 
Time to provide the needed resources. </p>
<p>The HUDF observations began Sept. 24, 2003 and continued through Jan. 16, 
2004. The telescope's ACS camera, the size of a phone booth, captured 
ancient photons of light that began traversing the universe even before 
Earth existed. Photons of light from the very faintest objects arrived at 
a trickle of one photon per minute, compared with millions of photons per 
minute from nearer galaxies. </p>
<p>Just like the previous HDFs, the new data are expected to galvanize the 
astronomical community and lead to dozens of research papers that will 
offer new insights into the birth and evolution of galaxies. </p><p><span class="import">Release Date:</span>
