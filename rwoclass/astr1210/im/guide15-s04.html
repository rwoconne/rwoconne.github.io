<h2>A. THE "INFERIOR" PLANETS </p></h2>

<ul>

<li> Mercury and Venus are called "inner" or <em>"inferior"</em> planets
because they are <u>closer to the Sun</u> than is Earth</p>

<li> Both revolve around the Sun in shorter times than the Earth (88 and 225 days,
respectively).</p>


<p><br></p>

<center><img src="im/plan-configs-FB-sm.gif" border=2></p></center>


<li> Planet-Sun <em>configurations</em> </p>

<ul>

<li> <em>Elongation</em> is the angular distance of a planet from
the Sun as viewed from Earth.   </p>


<li> See the illustration above.  As viewed from the Earth, the two
planets inside the Earth's orbit can never appear at large angles from
the Sun.  Mercury and Venus always stay within 27<sup>o</sup> and
48<sup>o</sup>, respectively, of the Sun.  These are their "maximal
elongations."  </p>

<ul>

<li> Copernicus showed that in his heliocentric model, the sizes of the
orbits of the planets (with respect to Earth's orbit) could be deduced
from these angles.  In the Ptolemaic model, there was no simple
geometric method for determining the sizes of the planetary orbits.</p>

</ul>

<li> Consequently, Venus and Mercury are visible in the sky <a
href="im/merc-ven-sunset-horiz-BC.jpg" target=show>only near sunset or
sunrise</a>.  Venus is the most common <a href="im/shasta-moon-ven-ex.jpg"
target=show>evening or morning "star."</a></p>

<li> Because Venus' orbital period is similar to Earth's, it tends
to linger in the sky near the horizon for many weeks at a time.  [Recall
the planetarium simulations shown during our discussion of the Mayan obsession
with Venus.]</p>

<li> Because of the high albedo (~70%) produced by its thick cloud
layers and its proximity to Earth, Venus is the <u>brightest object in
the sky other than the Sun or the Moon</u>.  Its intense brightness
and white color make it look artificial. </p>

<ul><ul>

<li> ===> Venus is the classic "UFO"</p>

</ul></ul>


<li> The planets outside Earth's orbit (<em>"superior"</em> planets),
starting with Mars, can be seen at up to 180<sup>o</sup> from the
Sun.  At that point they are highest in the sky at midnight and are
said to be at <em>"opposition"</em> with respect to the Sun.</p>

<ul>

<li>  As the
figure shows, when a planet is at opposition, it is also
<em>nearest</em> the Earth and therefore brightest.  It will also be
undergoing its fastest "retrograde motion" at that point. </p>

</ul>

</ul>

<li> Venus has been a major destination of  space missions, including
orbiters and landers.  Mercury has been visited only by a flyby
mission. </p>

</ul>

<p><br></p>

<h2>B. MERCURY</h2>

<ul>

<li> Less well-studied than others (only 1 spacecraft visit).</p>

<li> Density:  5.4 grams/cc ===> richer in heavies than Earth</p>


<li> Surface?  like Moon, with differences (e.g. shallower craters) due
to slower cooling and  higher gravity</p>


<li> Important test of <em>General Relativity</em>, the revised interpretation
of gravity by Einstein.  Mercury's perihelion shifts
43 arc-seconds/century more than in Newton's theory [1/10 millionth 
of orbital motion per orbit]; predicted exactly
by Einstein's GR theory (1916).  </p>

</ul>

<h2>C. VENUS: INTRODUCTION</h2>

<ul>

Near "twin" of Earth:  diameter (95%); mass (82%); distance
from Sun (0.7 AU)</p>

But unlike Earth, <u>thick cloud layers</u> completely obscure
surface.  See image above (click for enlargement).</p>

<ul>

<li> The surface of the planet CANNOT be
studied from outside atmosphere at optical wavelengths. </p>

<li>Clouds in planetary atmospheres are composed of <u>liquid droplets or
ice crystals</u> and are distinct from the atmosphere (<u>gas</u>) in which they
are embedded </p>

<li>Therefore, we <u>can't</u> determine cloud composition by spectroscopy
(easy only for vapors). </p>

<li>Originally thought to be water clouds, suggesting wet, jungle-like
planet.  </p>

</ul>

USSR & USA space missions to Venus: orbiters, atmospheric
probes, and short-survival landers.</p>

</b></small></p>

 </center>

</ul>


Best mapping technique: use <u><em>radar</em></u> to penetrate clouds</p>

<ul>

<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/magellan/guide5.html"
target=show>Radar systems</a> emit a short <u>burst</u> of radio waves
and then detect the reflected burst to determine a target's distance
and (through the Doppler effect) motion.</p>

Interpreting radar images: brighter regions are more
reflective of radar waves, meaning they are rougher.  Darker
regions are smoother.</p>

</ul>

<h2>D. VENUS: SURFACE/TOPOGRAPHY</h2>

<ul>

Determined by <a
href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/magellan/guide5.html" target=show>radar
mapping</a>.  Image above is a relief
radar map of Venus from the Pioneer mission.  Best
coverage: Magellan (radar orbiter, 1990-94).</p>

Overall topography flatter than Earth.  Only <u>two "continent"-like
features</u> (Ishtar and Aphrodite in map above).  </p>

<ul>
Continents and domelike features are evidence of modest <u>tectonic</u> activity,
but much less conspicuous than on Earth.  No plates.  Activity probably
dormant now.</p>

</ul>

Vast <u>lava flows</u> cover 85% of surface, but are neither impact
basins (like the Moon's marias) nor tectonic-related  (like Earth ocean
beds).  Most are smooth.  Little current eruptive activity.</p>

Many <u>volcanoes</u>, from 500 km diameter to tiny vents; 3000 over 20 km diameter;
100,000 altogether! </p>

<ul>

<center>
<a href="im/pancake-domes.gif" target=show><img src="im/pancake-domes-sm.gif"></a>
</p>

<small><b>Above are four overlapping volcanic domes.  They average about 16
miles in diameter with maximum heights of 2,500 feet. They were
produced by eruptions of thick lava coming from a vent on the
relatively level ground, allowing the lava to flow in an even lateral
pattern.  Click for enlargement.</b></small>  </p>

</center>

</ul>


<a href="im/danilova-lg.gif" target=show><img src="im/venus-danilova-crat.gif"
alt="DanilovaCrater" align="right"></a>

Many <u>impact craters</u>, but fewer per square mi than Moon, Mercury.
This implies a <em>younger</em> surface than those planets, ~500
million years old (as opposed to 4 billion).</p>

<ul>

<li> Shown at right is a radar image of a 30-mile diameter impact
crater surrounded by a bright "splash blanket" of ejecta.  Click 
for a larger view. </p>

</ul>

<u>Uniform distribution of craters (unique!)</u>.  Implies whole
surface formed at one time---unlike Earth, Moon, Mars.  Is evidence
for <u>sudden catastrophic melting & resurfacing</u> of the whole planet,
possibly induced by thick crust. </p>

<ul>

<li>Surface history will be discussed in the video "Venus Unveiled"</p>

</ul>

</ul>

<p><br></p>

<h2>E. VENUS: ATMOSPHERE</h2>

<ul>

Dense, hot, dry, corrosive [no tropical paradise!]</p>

Mainly carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</p>

H<sub>2</sub>O vapor only 1/10000 of abundance on Earth, and no water
on surface.  Dessicated planet/atmosphere.  </p>

<ul>

<li> We will find later that the absence of water is a key to the
bizarre properties of the Venusian atmosphere.</p>

</ul>

Clouds = <u>sulfuric acid(!)</u> droplets</p>

<ul>

<li> From volcanic outgassing in absence of rainfall</p>

</ul>

<img align="right" src="im/Ven-atmos-profile-CM.jpg" hspace=10 vspace=6> 

See atmospheric profile chart at right:</p>

<ul>

<li>  Remarkable difference from Earth atmosphere</p>

<li>  Earth surface-like temperatures and pressures occur at an
altitude of <u>50 km</u> in Venus atmosphere.  Below that, pressures
and temperatures are <u>much higher</u> than on Earth.</p>

<li>  Surface Temp  ~ 750<sup>o</sup>K (480<sup>o</sup>C)!  </p>

<li> [Hotter than Mercury despite larger distance from Sun.] </p>


<li>Surface Pressure = 90x Earth's.  Implies Venus'
atmosphere is 90x more massive than Earth's!</p>

</ul>

The high temperature is produced by the <em>Greenhouse Effect</em></p>

<ul>

<li> Main heat input to atmosphere is from Sun (true for all planets,
including Earth).  Occurs mainly at visible wavelengths, where Sun
is brightest.</p>

<li> Cooling is by radiation to space.  Occurs at infrared wavelengths.</p>

<li> Final temperature is determined by the <u>equilibrium</u> point where
the heating rate equals the cooling rate.</p>

<li> Certain gases (CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O) act like
a blanket.  Partially prevent radiative cooling (at infrared
wavelengths).</p>

<li> ===> 30<sup>o</sup> rise on Earth but 400<sup>o</sup> rise on
Venus because of massive atmosphere.</p>

</ul>

</ul>

<p><br></p>


<h2>F.  VENUS AND EARTH</h2>

The incredible difference between the terrestrial and the Venusian
atmospheres was a great shock to astronomers.  How can Venus and
Earth, despite similarities in size, mass, and distance from Sun, be so
different?  The seemingly small difference in distance to the Sun
(30%) probably is the culprit, as we will see in <a
href="guide19-s04">Study Guide 19</a>.</p>

Thus, there are two reasons that Venus is totally unsuitable for
a biosphere: the atmosphere and the catastrophic resurfacing (which
could be cyclic).  Venus is a sobering lesson in comparative
planetology.</p>
