<h2>A. The "Inferior" Planets</h2>

Mercury and Venus are called "inner" or <b><em>"inferior"</em></b> planets
because they are <b>closer to the Sun</b> than is Earth</p>

Both revolve around the Sun in shorter times than the Earth (88 and 225 days,
respectively).</p>


<p><br></p>

<center><img src="im/plan-configs-FB.gif" vspace=10 width=60%></p></center>


<h3> Planet-Sun <em>Configurations</em></h3> </p>

<ul>

<li><b> <em>Elongation</em></b> is the angular distance of a planet from
the Sun as viewed from Earth.   The term <b>"configurations"</b> refers
to the various characteristic elongations possible for planets
as shown in the figure above. </p>


<li> See the illustration above.  As viewed from the Earth, the two
planets inside the Earth's orbit can <b>never</b> appear at large angles from
the Sun.  Mercury and Venus always stay within 27<sup>o</sup> and
48<sup>o</sup>, respectively, of the Sun.  These are their "maximal
elongations."  </p>

<ul>

<li> Copernicus showed that in his heliocentric model, the sizes of the
orbits of Mercury and Venus (with respect to Earth's orbit) could be deduced
from these angles.  In the Ptolemaic model, there was no simple
geometric method for determining the sizes of the planetary orbits.</p>

</ul>

<li> Consequently, Venus and Mercury are visible in the
sky <a href="im/merc-ven-sunset-horiz-BC.jpg"><b>only near sunset or
sunrise</b></a>.  Venus is the most
common <a href="im/shasta-moon-ven-ex.jpg">evening or morning
"star."</a></p>

<li> Because Venus' orbital period is similar to Earth's, it tends
to linger in the sky near the horizon for many weeks at a time.  [Recall
the planetarium simulations shown during our discussion of the Maya obsession
with Venus.]</p>

<li> Because of its proximity to Earth and the high albedo (~70%)
produced by its thick cloud layers, Venus is the <b>brightest object in
the sky other than the Sun or the Moon</b>.  Its intense brightness
and white color make it look artificial. </p>

<ul><ul>

<li> ===> Venus is the classic "Unidentified Flying Object" (UFO).  See
<a href="guide18.html">Guide 18</a> for more discussion.</p>

</ul></ul>

<li> The planets outside Earth's orbit (<b><em>"superior"</em></b> planets),
starting with Mars, can be seen at up to 180<sup>o</sup> from the
Sun.  At that point they are highest in the sky at midnight and are
said to be at <b><em>"opposition"</em></b> with respect to the Sun.</p>

<ul>

<li>  As the
figure shows, when a planet is at opposition, it is also
<b>nearest the Earth</b> and therefore brightest.  It will also be
undergoing its <b>fastest "retrograde motion"</b> at that point. </p>

</ul>
</ul>

<p><br></p>

<h2>B. Mercury</h2>

Mercury is hard to observe from Earth because it is above
the nighttime horizon only for brief periods.</p>

<a href="im/poplygnotus-basin-region-messenger.jpg"><img
src="im/poplygnotus-basin-region-messenger.jpg" align="right" width=25%
hspace=10 vspace=10></a>

It has been less well-studied than most other planets (until 2007
there had been only 2 spacecraft visits, both flybys, in
contrast to Venus, which has been a major destination of space
missions, including orbiters and landers). </p>

<ul>

 <a href="http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/the_mission/index.html">Messenger</a>
is an ongoing mission to study Mercury at close range in
3 <a href="im/MESSENGER_trajectory.svg.jpg" >flybys</a> followed by
long-term in-orbit observations.
</ul>

Average density:  5.4 grams/cc, like Earth, but mass (& therefore
gravity compression) is smaller  ===> richer in heavy elements than Earth</p>

<!-- 
 <a href="im/merc-near-caloris-lg.jpg" >
-->

<a href="im/mercury-M10-incomingview.jpg" >Surface</a> is
similar to Earth's Moon (impact-driven terrain), but with differences</a> (e.g.
shallower craters) due to slower cooling and higher gravity.  See
image at right and compare to Earth's Moon topography 
<a href="moontop.html">here</a>.</p>

Mercury's orbit is an important test of <em>General Relativity</em>,
the revised interpretation of gravity by Einstein.  Mercury's
perihelion (the closest point to the Sun in its elliptical orbit)
shifts 43 arc-seconds/century more than predicted for Newtonian
gravity [only 1/10 millionth of total orbital motion per orbit, but
this can be measured highly accurately over many orbits].  The extra
amount is predicted exactly by Einstein's GR theory (1916).  </p>

<h2>C. Venus: Introduction</h2>

Near "twin" of Earth:  diameter (95%); mass (82%); distance
from Sun (0.7 AU)</p>

But unlike Earth, <b>thick cloud layers</b> completely obscure
surface.  See image above (click for enlargement).</p>

<ul> 

<li> The surface of the planet CANNOT be
studied from outside its atmosphere at optical wavelengths. </p>

<li><b>Clouds</b> in planetary atmospheres are composed of <b>liquid droplets or
ice crystals</b> and are distinct from the atmosphere (<b>gas</b>) in which they
are embedded </p>

<li>Therefore, we <b>can't</b> determine cloud composition by spectroscopy
(easy only for vapors). </p>

<li>Originally thought to be water clouds, suggesting wet, jungle-like
planet.  </p>

</ul>

USSR & USA space missions to Venus: orbiters, atmospheric
probes, and short-survival <a href="im/venera-on-Vensurf-artists.jpg"

<small><b>Above is a wide angle color image of Venus' surface returned
by the USSR Venera 13 lander (1982).  It shows a lava-strewn plain,
extending to the horizon at right.  Color is produced by the thick
cloud layer. Click for enlargement.  </b></small></p>

 </center>

</ul>


Best mapping technique: use <b><em>radar</em></b> to penetrate clouds</p>

<ul>

<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/magellan/guide5.html"
>Radar systems</a> emit a short <b>burst of radio waves</b>
and then detect the reflected burst to determine a target's distance
and (through the Doppler effect) motion.</p>

Interpreting radar images: brighter regions are more
reflective of radar waves, meaning they are rougher.  Darker
regions are smoother.</p>

</ul>

<h2>D. VENUS: SURFACE/TOPOGRAPHY</h2>


Determined by <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/magellan/guide5.html"
>radar mapping</a>.  Image above is a relief radar map of
Venus from the Pioneer mission.  Best coverage: <a
href="http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/magellan/mgn.html" >Magellan</a>
(radar orbiter, 1990-94).</p>

Overall topography flatter than Earth.  Only <b>two "continent"-like
features</b> (Ishtar and Aphrodite in map above).  </p>

<ul> Continents and domelike features are evidence of modest
<b>tectonic</b> activity, but <b>much less conspicuous</b> than on
Earth, as can be seen in the comparison images above.  No plates.
Activity probably dormant now.</p>

</ul>

Vast <b>lava flows</b> cover 85% of surface, but are neither impact
basins (like the Moon's marias) nor tectonic-related  (like Earth ocean
beds).  Most are smooth.  Little current eruptive activity.</p>

Many <b>volcanoes</b>, from 500 km diameter to tiny vents; 3000 over
20 km diameter; 100,000 altogether! </p>

<ul>

<center>
<a href="im/pancake-domes.gif" ><img src="im/pancake-domes-sm.gif"></a>
</p>

<small><b>Image shows four overlapping volcanic domes.  They average
about 16 miles in diameter with maximum heights of 2,500 feet. They
were produced by eruptions of thick lava coming from a vent on the
relatively level ground, allowing the lava to flow in an even lateral
pattern.  Click for enlargement.</b></small> </p>

</ul>


<a href="im/danilova-lg.gif" ><img src="im/venus-danilova-crat.gif"
alt="DanilovaCrater" align="right" hspace=10, vspace=10></a>

Many <b>impact craters</b>, but fewer per square mile than Moon, Mercury.
This implies a <em>younger</em> surface than those planets, ~500
million years old (as opposed to 4 billion).</p>

<ul>

<li> Shown at right is a radar image of a 30-mile diameter impact
crater surrounded by a bright "splash blanket" of ejecta.  Click 
for a larger view. </p>

</ul>

Surprisingly, Venus shows a <b>uniform distribution of craters</b> across
its surface. </p>

<ul> 

This situation is unique in the solar system (see discussions in other
Guides of the Moon and the outer satellites). </p>

It implies the whole surface <b>formed at one time</b>.  Judged by
the density of impact craters, the surface is relatively young---about 500 Myr
old.  The combined evidence indicates that the entire planet underwent
<b>sudden catastrophic melting & resurfacing</b>, possibly induced by
heat trapping under a thick crust.  </p>

<li>Venus' surface history will be discussed in the video "Venus
Unveiled"</p>

</ul>

<p><br></p>

<h2>E. VENUS: ATMOSPHERE</h2>

Dense, hot, dry, corrosive.  No tropical paradise!</p>

Mainly carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</p>

H<sub>2</sub>O vapor only 1/10000 of abundance on Earth, and no water
on surface.  Dessicated planet/atmosphere.  </p>

<ul>


<img align="right" src="im/Ven-atmos-profile-CM.jpg" hspace=10 vspace=10> 

<li> We will find later (<a href="guide19.html" >Study
Guide 19</a>) that the <b>absence of water</b> is a key to the bizarre
properties of the Venusian atmosphere.</p>

</ul>

Clouds = <b>sulfuric acid(!!)</b> droplets</p>

<ul>

<li> From volcanic outgassing in absence of rainfall</p>

</ul>

See atmospheric profile chart at right:</p>

<ul>

<li>  Remarkable differences from Earth atmosphere</p>

<li> Temperatures and pressures like those at Earth's surface occur at
an altitude of <b>50 km</b> in Venus atmosphere.  Below that, pressures
and temperatures are <b>much higher</b> than on Earth.</p>

<li>  Surface Temp  ~ 750<sup>o</sup>K (480<sup>o</sup>C)!  </p>

<li> [Hotter than Mercury despite its larger distance from the Sun.] </p>


<li>Surface Pressure = 90x Earth's.  Implies Venus'
atmosphere is 90x more massive than Earth's!</p>

</ul>

<a name="Greenhouse">

<h3>The Greenhouse Effect</h3>

Venus would be warmer than the Earth simply because it is nearer the
Sun.  But the extraordinarily high Venusian temperature is not caused
by higher solar input.  Instead, it is produced by
the <a href="im/greenhouse-effect-okanagan.jpg" ><em>Greenhouse
Effect</em></a>, an atmospheric process which inhibits surface
cooling.</p>

<ul>

<li> The Greenhouse Effect was first recognized in the 1820's, and the
first quantitative discussion was published by Arrhenius in 1896.</p>

<li> The main heat input to any planetary atmosphere (including
Earth's) is from the Sun.  This occurs mainly at <b>visible</b> wavelengths,
where the Sun is brightest.</p>

<li> Cooling from the surface is by <b>radiation to space</b>.  Because the
temperature of planetary surfaces is (fortunately for us!) much lower
than the Sun's, this occurs not at visible but instead at <b>infrared</b>
wavelengths.</p>

<ul>  (See <a href="121supps2-3.html">Supplements
II and III</a> to remind yourself of the characteristics of radiation
from dense objects like planets.) </p>
</ul>

<li> The average temperature is determined by the <b>equilibrium</b> point, where
the heating rate balances the cooling rate.</p>

<li> Certain "Greenhouse gases" (H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>,
CH<sub>4</sub>) act like a blanket to "trap the heat."  They
preferentially <b>absorb</b> infrared radiation and <b>reflect</b> it
back to the surface, thereby reducing radiative cooling.  </p>

<li> This causes a significant temperature rise to the point where the
surface can radiate as much energy to space (through the Greenhouse
blocking) as it receives from the Sun.  The situation is like the level
of a lake adjusting to the increased height of its outlet dam.</p>

<li> Because all of the surface cooling must take place in the
infrared, any gas that can impede IR radiation is an effective
Greenhouse agent.  Even the tiny amounts of Greenhouse gases in the
Earth's atmosphere can have a big
effect.  <a href="im/atmospheric-trans-abs-vs-wavel-Wiki.png">Here</a>
is a chart that shows the radiative input, output, and Greenhouse gas
blocking as a function of wavelength.</p>

<li> On Earth, where the Greenhouse gases are only "trace" constituents
of the atmosphere (CO<sub>2</sub> totals only 0.04% of the
atmosphere's mass), the <b>Greenhouse temperature increase is
a modest 30</b><sup>o</sup><b> K (or 54</b><sup>o</sup><b> F)</b>, which is
just enough to keep Earth's surface "comfortable" by human standards
and prevent the oceans from freezing over.</p>

<li>But on Venus, where the atmosphere is almost pure CO<sub>2</sub> and massive
enough to block large regions of the infrared spectrum, the
<b>temperature rise is 400</b><sup>o</sup><b> K</b>.

</ul>

<p><br></p>

<h2>F.  VENUS AND EARTH</h2>

The incredible differences between the terrestrial and the Venusian
atmospheres were a great shock to astronomers.  How can Venus and
Earth, despite similarities in size, mass, and distance from Sun, be so
different?  The culprit is probably the seemingly small difference in
<b>distance to the Sun</b> (30%), as we will see in <a
href="guide19.html">Study Guide 19</a>.</p>

<ul>

Venus is totally unsuitable for a biosphere for two entirely different
reasons:  its horrific atmosphere and its episodes of catastrophic
resurfacing (which could be cyclic).</p>

Venus is a sobering lesson in comparative planetology.</p>
