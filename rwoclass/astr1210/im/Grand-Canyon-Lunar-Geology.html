<h2>What's the Connection?</h2>
<p>
<p>Until the 1960's only a few prescient individuals thought of the Moon
and the terrestrial planets as objects like the Earth.  Then, because 
of the race to put men on the Moon, the time for this approach had
come.  Scientists began to apply well-established principles of Earth
science, first to the Moon, and then to Mars and Mercury.  A new
dimension of planetary science was opened.  It had been there all along,
of course, but the scientists were as usual 
mostly confined to their little cubbyholes of 
speciality.  The idea had to await its time.

<br clear=left>
<p>The advent of this new dimension was reflected in the language.
People began to speak of <i>astrogeology</i>, <i>planetary geology</i>,
or simply <i>planetology</i>.  A new breed of scientist joined the
investigation of celestial bodies--those with a firm background in Earth
science--and the discipline was immensely enriched.  
<p>It had happened only a short time before.   Immediately following the
close of World War II, electrical engineers with backgrounds in radar,
opened the radio window to the universe, adding such things as quasars
and the cosmic background radiation to the classical astronomer's
universe.  
<p>In this essay, we will describe some fundamental methods of planetary 
geology for the interested layperson.  We couldn't find a better place
to illustrate the geological ideas than the Grand Canyon.  Here many of
the layers of the Earth's history are plain to see.  Equally fascinating
are the missing layers, where the history is unavailable.  We will get to
them later.  For the present, hold this thought: the planetary geology
that we emphasize here is concerned with <i>history</i>.   
Of the four physical sciences, astronomy
and geology share a historical dimension that is absent in chemistry
and physics.  One of the more important tools used by planetary
scientists to enter this dimension is geological mapping using 
standard <i>stratigraphic principles</i>.  We will illustrate them with the
help of images from the Grand Canyon.

<p>A <a href="http://harrimanrocks.rutgers.edu"> new (July 2002) web site </a>
describes geological methods and their application to the <i>history</i> of
a region in southern New York state.  The site has many illustrations,
links, definitions, and tutorials.

<p>The application of these principles to the Moon and planets 
began in earnest with study of lunar features, by the geologist 
Eugene Shoemaker (1928-1997).  
Before we discuss his work, we must review some basic
ideas.
<p>
<h2>Geology and Selenology</h2>
<p>
<p>Selenology is a somewhat old-fashioned word that means the study of
the origin and history of lunar features.  
Today, almost no one uses the term selenology.  Instead, it is common to 
speak of lunar geology, or more generally, planetary geology. 
<p>Until the middle of the 20th
Century, about all that could be done with lunar features was to
photograph and classify them, and give them names.  
There was no general agreement about the nature of these features, but
there were two main theories.  The lunar features were either volcanic
in nature, or caused by impacts of meteoroids.  Interestingly, the
theories were rarely mixed.  Advocates of the impact theory sought
to explain the maria in as oceans of small ejecta.  Advocates of
volcanism, had the right explanation for the maria, lava flows, but
were mostly wrong about the craters themselves. 
 
<p>Only in the 
years immediately following World War II did it become clear that the
lunar craters were created by explosive impacts rather than volcanic
activity.  Since the lunar surface is dominated by craters spanning a
huge spectrum of sizes,  we could not know much about
the Moon until we realized what these craters were.  While many names
are associated with the impact theory for the origin of lunar craters,
perhaps the most influential was Ralph Baldwin, a graduate of the University
of Michigan, and PhD from its Astronomy Department.  We must leave a 
discussion of Baldwin's contribution to references.  We recommend
Don E. Wilhelms's <i>To a Rocky Moon: A Geologist's History of Lunar
Exploration</i> (Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1993).  This is
a good source for the work of Baldwin, and for much of this essay. 
<p>Soon after the nature of the craters were clarified, true lunar geology
could begin.  Much of the work was
done by employees of the US Geological survey, with 
(for them) standard geological techniques.   Until the return
of lunar samples, the analysis was largely by the principle of
superposition.  This is a refined version of common-sense
notions: a layer on top is younger than layers beneath it; if a rock
wall if fractured, the wall is older than the fracture, and if a vein
passes through a rock, the vein is younger than its host.  The
principle of superposition was recognized centuries ago. 

<p>In the case of the Moon, one couldn't see veins in the rocks from the
Earth, and any layering one could make out was pretty rudimentary.  
Nevertheless, some history was plain to see.  Craters were seen
to destroy the rims of other craters, so the craters with the damaged
rims were surely older than those that destroyed their rims.  

<p>Impact craters are surrounded by blankets of material ejected in the
explosions, and in some cases these ejecta form a system of bright,
radial rays.  The brightness of the rays associated with the ejecta
varies from crater to crater, fading to indistinctness.  It was readily
seen by careful examination that  the rays of some  craters cut across
and obliterated the rays of others.  A crater whose rays were 
cut or distorted by another was clearly the older of the two, and it
was immediately found that the brightness of the rays was an indication
of crater youth.  Young craters had bright rays.   
 
<p>The Principle of Superposition gives only relative ages.  These
relative ages were about all that the 18th and 19th century founders of
modern geology had to work with.  Until the return of the Apollo
samples, the same was true for the Moon.
Since the scientists could not date geological
materials chronologically, they gave them names.  These names have been
the bane of many a student of introductory geology: Why not just say a
layer is 70 million years old, rather than saying it is Cretaceous?  The
reason is that the people who assigned certain geological materials to
the Cretaceous did not know how old they were. 
<p>
<h2>Eons, Eras, Periods, and Epochs</h2>
<p>When terrestrial materials can be dated by radioactive techniques,
they may be placed into one or another of geological time units.
The largest of these units is the Eon,
and it has become generally used only in the latter part of the 20th
century.  The reason for this is fairly straightforward.  While it has
been known that the Earth is between 4 and 5 billion years old for a
century, only the most recent half billion years has been studied in 
detail.  This is because fossils, which are still used as 
indicators of the age of geological layers, are virtually nonexistent 
in rock layers
older than about 570 million years (roughly half a billion years).

<p>Intensive searches for the existence of life before this time have
revealed traces of living cells well before the once-impermeable
veil some 570 million years back.  The record for fossils at the time
of this writing is 3.5 billion years ago.  The story of the discovery
is told by William Schopf in his book <i>Cradle of Life</i>.  There
is indirect evidence, from carbon isotopes, that life forms were
present on the Earth as early as about 4 billion years ago.  The oldest
Earth rocks are hardly older than this.  

<p>These findings make it meaningful to divide the Earth's history into
time chunks called <i>Eons</i>, of the order of a billion years.  
Prior to the introduction of the Eon, the largest division was the 
Era, with time divisions of the order of a hundred million (0.1 billion)
years.  There is an exception to this.  The <i>Pre-Cambrian Era</i>
included all of the time from the Earth's beginning to a time 
570 million years back, so it spanned some 4 billion years!  

<p>The next two divisions of geological time were respectively the Period
and the Epoch, characterized by intervals of the order of several tens
or several million years respectively.  Table 1 is a summary.  Remember
that 100 million years is 0.1 billion years.

<h2>The Geologic Column </h2>
<p>
<p>Geologists typically illustrate the divisions of time with the help
of block-type diagrams that they call ``the geologic column.''  In
Figure 1, we illustrate the two biggest time divisions.  Recall that
eons were not widely used until the end of the 20th century.  This was
primarily because geologists had relatively little data on this the
largest of the eras.  While this is still the case, <i>sufficient</i>
information is available that the more uniform divisions, the eons, 
have come into general use.
<p>
<center>
<p><strong>Figure 1: Eons and Eras</strong>
<p><img src="EonEra.gif">
</center>
<p>

<p>The oldest and largest of the eras, the Pre-Cambrian, takes its name
from the oldest of the smaller time division, the Period.  Periods
and epochs are shown in Figure 2.   
<p>
<center>
<p><strong>Figure 2: Periods and Epochs</strong>
<p><img src="PeriodEpoch.gif">
</center>
<p>
<p>The columns illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 have definite times associated 
with the different names and divisions.  This was only possible after
radioactive dating came into use near the beginning of the 20th century.
What did 19th-century geologists do?  The answer is that they used the
principle of superposition and <i>relative ages</i>.  A number of the names
of Figures 1 and 2, especially of the more recent periods and epochs,  
appeared in the classic text of Charles Lyell (cf. vol. III, Table II, 1833).
Lyell had the relative order correct, and some of the terms that he used
are still employed, sometimes with different meanings.    
<p>Geological <i>systems</i>, and <i>series</i> mean very nearly the
same as periods and epochs.  For most purposes, one need not distinguish
the meanings.  The names of geological eras and systems are usually
the same.  Thus we have the Jurassic <i>system</i> and the Jurassic
<i>period</i>, which most laypersons may be excused for using 
interchangeably.   
<p>Geological materials (layers, rocks, lava flows, etc.)
are assigned to systems or series on the basis of properties <i>other</i>
than radioactively determined dates.  For example, one may use the
principle of superposition, or the fossil content of limestone layers. 
Thus 18th and 19th century
geologists could (and did) map the surface rocks into systems and
series.  Some noble efforts not withstanding, they did not have the 
means to assign absolute times.    
<p>This is the situation that applies to every planetary surface (ca.
2000) other than those of the Earth and Moon.   Indeed, lunar systems
and series were delineated prior to the return of the Apollo samples,
as we discuss momentarily.
Even though it is now possible to apply absolute ages lunar maps
still refer to systems.  
<p>The reader who wishes a thorough tour (in bewildering detail) through
stratigraphic nomenclature, may consult the url:
http://www.agiweb.org/nacsn/code2.html#Article72.
We shall simplify the classification with the help of the following 
table.  Entries in parenthesis are rarely used, and may be ignored 
by all but the experts.

<p>
<p>One more set of words used by terrestrial and planetary geologists
needs to be discussed.  Geological materials that are less closely
related to time are classified into <i>groups</i> or <i>formations</i>.
The group is the larger division, and may contain several formations.
These <i>rock stratigraphic units</i> may have additional divisions that
we will not need here.
The units are distinguished from one another directly by the
materials themselves.  The connection with time may be immediate and
obvious, as will be the case with some of the formations that we shall
discuss for the Grand Canyon, or they may not be.  

<p>One example of a
stratigraphic unit that may cut across time boundaries is that of the
sandy beach of an evaporating sea.  If the sea slowly evaporates or
drains, beach sand will move from the outer boundary of the young
sea to successive inner peripheries. 
The compacted beach sandstone may be uniform in appearance, and
yet cut across a wide range of geological times.  

<p>The Grand Canyon layers are most often referred to as groups or
formations even though their position in time is well understood.
This is a matter of custom, and historical precedent.  It is well
understood by the specialist, but can be confusing.  It is often the
case that when geological terms are applied to extraterrestrial bodies,
that the conventions get displaced.  A good example might be the 
so-called lunar systems.  They are now well known to span time intervals
of billions of years, and thus should be called by the little-used
term "eonothem," which has the rank corresponding to the eon (see
Table 1).  

<p>After this introduction to stratigraphic nomenclature, we now take a
look at the geologic column for the Grand Canyon, and some examples of
how the nomenclature is applied.  Then in the following section, we will
consider the extension of these concepts to the moons and planets.
<p>
<h2>Stratigraphy of the Grand Canyon</h2>
<p>
<p>Figure 3 shows a conceptual cut through the Grand Canyon alongside
a geologic column.  Of the many remarkable  aspects of the Canyon is 
that it's most recent layers belong to the Paleozoic epoch, and are
already some 250 million years old.  (Times on this and the previous
figure were taken from different references, and agree only
approximately.)  
<p>Several hundred million years of the Earth's history
have been eroded and washed away from the Colorado Plateau in the region
of the Canyon!  A close look at some of the layers within the Paleozoic
show that this has happened before.  No layers represent the Ordovician
or Silurian periods.  Roughly a hundred million years is missing between
the Temple Bute formation and the Muav Limestone. This missing time is
referred to as an "unconformity."  A more obvious example of this
phenomenon is the <i>great uncomformity,</i>where the  
Tapeats sandstone sits atop and truncates the tilted members of the 
<i>Grand Canyon Supergroup</i>.  Presumably, additional material belonging to
these tilted layers once existed.  However, when the region was
uplifted, the missing regions would have been higher than those which
remain in the Supergroup.  Erosion and weathering removed them, and 
the Tapeats Sandstone was eventually deposited on top of what remained. 
<p>The oldest rocks through which the river cuts extend
into the Pre-Cambrian, though not as far as the Archean eon.
<p>The decision to refer to a layer of similar rocky or sedimentary
materials as a group rather than a formation is somewhat arbitrary.
We shall use the top layers of the Canyon as an illustration of the
concepts of groups and formations.  The layers we consider begin and
end in Permian period, the youngest division of the Paleozoic. 
<p>The uppermost layer of the Canyon is called the Kaibab Limestone.
It is followed by the Toroweap formation, the Coconino Sandstone,
and the Hermit Shale.  The first set of layers considered part of a
group are members of the Supai.  Divisions of the Supai Group have
the tongue-twisting names of Esplanade, Wescogame, Manakacha, and
Watahomigi.  The latter three are classified as formations, while the 
Esplanade is actually considered a ``subgroup.'' 
<p>

<p>  
<p>In late May of 2000, my sons, granddaughter, her Mom, and I hiked for
about a mile down the Bright Angel Trail of the south rim of the Canyon.
<p>
<img src="FamilyGC2.gif" width=256 height=206 align=right hspace=20>
<p>
<p>The idea was to get some images of the named layers from a distance
that would be close enough so they could be seen distinctly, but not so
close that the divisions would appear merged.  I also had a guide to the
trail, so it was possible to identify the layers unambiguously.  Figure
4 shows the the top layers,  and it is easy to see the divisions between
them.   
<p>
<p><strong>Figure 4: Top Layers of the Grand Canyon.</strong>  The image
was taken near the beginning of the Bright Angel Trail. 
<center><img src="Gra2000_6.gif"></center>
<p>
<p>Subtle information is contained in the names of the layers.  The top
4 qualify as formations, yet the Kaibab is called the Kaibab
<i>Limestone</i>, the Coconino the Coconino <i>Sandstone</i>, but 
the Toroweap is called the Toroweap <i>Formation</i>.  This is because
the first two formations are mostly either limestone (Kaibab) or
sandstone (Coconino), but the Toroweap formation consists of <i>both</i>
limestone and sandstone.    
<p>The Coconino Sandstone is a distinctive layer, readily seen on the 
distant rim of Figure 4---so long as one knows what to look for.  One can
see lineations from compressed sand dunes in the closeup in Figure 5,
where the transition from the Toroweap formation is even more obvious
than in the previous figure.
<p>
<center>
<p><strong>Figure 5: The Coconino Sandstone</strong>
<p><img src="Gra2000_5a.gif"></center>
<p>
<p>Vertical cuts by a river or a roadbed are easy to associate with
steps (backward) in time.  But circumstances in the history of planetary
bodies conspire in such a way that steps along the surface can also be
steps in time.  This is readily illustrated in north-central Arizona.  
As our family drove westward toward the Grand Canyon, we soon passed
through areas where the surface rocks were only about a million years
old.  This fact may be seen from color changes on a geological map.  
<p>Figure 6 is a simplified example of a
geological map of a region of northern Arizona showing the Grand
Canyon and nearby Flagstaff on US 40.    The colors show the ages of
the surface rocks.  The Permian Kaibab limestones are marked P,  
including most of the region surrounding the Grand Canyon.  However, there
are much younger Tertiary volcanics (Tv) nearby as well as even
more recent Quaternary-Tertiary volcanics (QTv).  A region in the western
part of the state is mapped as Mississippian (M), one of the periods
of the Paleozoic.  This time corresponds to the layers of the Grand
Canyon belonging to the Redwall Limestone and Temple Bute formations,
but our map does not show these details.  We do indicate, with 
olive-green, parts of the Canyon where the
Colorado River cuts through Pre-Cambrian rocks  
(<IMG WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="absBOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="PreCam.gif">).
<p>It is common for
the symbols of a geological map to indicate the nature of the materials
as well as their age.  Thus `Tv' indicates not only the age, but also
the origin of the rocks--volcanic.   
Lunar and planetary maps follow this
convention.  For example, heavily cratered plains belonging to the 
Copernican system of the Moon, might be marked Cc. 
<p>

<p><strong>Figure 6: Schematic Geological Map.</strong>  The region
shown is in the region of the Grand Canyon. 
<p><img src="AzGC1b.gif">
</center>
<p>
<p>It is also common for the symbols associated with color (or shading
on a grayscale map) to indicate appropriate systems groups or
formations.  We will see examples on the lunar map below.   
<p>We could continue to discuss the fascinating features of the Grand
Canyon and its surroundings, but our purpose is to use them as an 
illustration of concepts that are of value in describing the surfaces 
of extraterrestrial bodies, and their histories.   
In the next sections, we begin our discussion of the lunar surface,
and give a short introduction to its geological mapping.
<h2>Lunar Nearside Features</h2>
<p>
<p>In the following sections, we will be referring to a few of the
specific craters and maria that appear on the nearside of the Moon.  
We need to know some of these names for the discussion to make sense. 
Therefore,
we present a lunar image, with some of the more important features
labeled.
<p>
<center>
<p>Figure 7: Some Features on the Nearside of the Moon-</strong> (Lick
composite photo, annotated by the author).
<p><img src="moon.gif"></center>
<p>
<p>The smooth, dark features are the maria or lunar seas.  They are
quite dry now, but they were once liquid rock, lava, which flowed out
smoothly, covering wide areas of the Moon.  Of the 9 maria labeled,
8 actually have "mare" (singular of maria) incorporated in their names.
Thus, the full names are Mare Imbrium, Mare Serenitatis, Mare
Tranquillitatis, etc.  Procellarum is known as <i>Oceanus</i> 
Procellarum.  The maria are generally thought to have been formed as 
a result of a single major impact event, which left a more or less
circular feature.  Of the nearside maria, Imbrium is the best defined,
and it is not surprising that the lunar geological history is most easily
followed by examining features near it.    No obvious center
exists for Procellarum.   Perhaps that is why
it has a unique name.

<p>If we omit Mare Crisium, the remaining 8 maria may be recalled using
the mnemonic: I'm Sure that Frogs Never Need Hair Pieces.  This gives us
the first letter of Imbrium, Serenitatis, Foecundatatis, Nectaris,
Nubium, Humorum, and Procellarum.  The mnemonic is from a student in 
an introductory astronomy course at the University of Michigan.
<p>One can understand most of the history of the moon and its current
form with the help of these 9 maria and the 5 (or 7) craters named in
the above figure.  Even the unaided eye can pick out the larger maria,
and with a small telescope for example, one can see the
major craters.  Since one can see these features in the sky for oneself,
it's worth knowing their names.  The Moon is the only extraterrestrial
object for which this is so.   
<p>
<h2>Geological Maps of the Moon</h2>
<p>
<p>Eugene Shoemaker was not the first to apply geological mapping
techniques to the lunar surface, but he was one of the pioneers, and
arguably the most important of them.  An illustration of just how ripe
this field was for the plucking may be seen in Shoemaker's 1962 study 
of the region surrounding the Copernicus crater.   It is based on a 
photographic copy of an image taken in 1929 by the astronomer Francis Pease.  
Schoemaker purchased his copy at the Cal Tech bookstore!  It's pretty
rare that 
ground-breaking research can be done with materials that cost about the
same as a fast food lunch, but the fruit was ripe, and Schoemaker was
there to pluck it.
<p>With the help of his bookstore photograph, 
Shoemaker divided lunar surface materials into five systems.  Four of
these are still in use.  From the oldest to the youngest, they are
the Pre-Imbrian, the Imbrian, the Eratosthenean, and the Copernican.
The basis for this division is readily seen in the region of the Moon
in the eastern and southern part of Mare Imbrium, and just south of the
outer Imbrian ring, where the craters Copernicus and Eratosthenes are
found.    
Shoemaker noted that rayed craters like 
Copernicus and their ejecta overlayed and sometimes destroyed parts of
craters with bright rays.  Thus rays could be taken as an indication of
relative youth, and indeed, the brighter the rays, the younger the
craters.  This relation seems to hold not only on the Moon, but on the
surfaces of Mercury, Mars, and other satellites.
<p>It is a little easier to illustrate the geological mapping of the
Moon with the help of Figures 7 and 8 (below) than with Shoemaker's
image from the Cal Tech bookstore.  First, we give ages to the named
systems as they are presented today.  This is shown in Table 2.

<p>
<p>Shoemaker associated his <i>systems</i> with the equivalent of geological
time units which he called <i>periods</i>.  This distinction is for the
experts, and we shall discuss the lunar systems as though the words
meant the same as lunar periods. 
<p>We have already noted that the lunar systems correspond to time 
intervals of one or more billions of years, far far more than
terrestrial systems.  The rock-stratigraphic term that corresponds
to billion-year intervals on the Earth is the eonothem.  But it seems
that term is used primarily to fill a space in a table such as our Table
1.  Planetary geologists have simply retained the "system" as the 
chrono-stratigraphic unit corresponding to the widest time interval.
This is true not only for the Moon, but also for Mars, and other
planetary and satellite surfaces that have been mapped.  

<p>It is common to group the Pre-Nectarian and Nectarian systems
into the Pre-Imbrian, as in Shoemaker's original paper.  We use
this simplification below.
The duration of the Nectarian is
relatively small.  If the time intervals
given here are correct, the  Nectarian lasted 3.92 - 3.85
= 0.08 billion years, or 80 million years.   This is short
relative to the other lunar systems.  Nevertheless, recent books
and articles on the Moon include the Nectarian System,  
so we include it here. 
<p>The isolated maria--unlike Procellarum--are thought to have
originated with a single meteoroid impact which left a series of
concentric mountain rings.  Basalt flooding and additional smaller
impacts obliterated the inner rings.  The regions are now called
basins. In the case of Imbrium, we can
see only a part of the outer ring, that is most well formed to the
southeast.  Nectaris though rounded, has no such notable ring fragment,
and the conclusion that it is older is easy to understand.
<p>Shoemaker originally identified a ``Procellarum system.''  
Regions belonging to it were smooth with relatively sparse
cratering, materials which we now identify with lava flows that
occurred some hundreds of millions of years after the impact 
that created the Imbrian basin.  Since Oceanus Procellarum consists
largely of such material, the basis for the category is obvious.
Later mappers ``demoted'' these materials from the chrono-stratigraphic
category (system) to the rock-stratigraphic category of 
the <i>Procellarum Group</i>, because it was not easy to place 
them securely in the Moon's history.   
Indeed, a close examination of  mare
reveals a boundaries where one lava flow overlapped another, clearly
showing the ages of the surfaces differ.  However, the amounts 
of time between the floods are not easily
determined.  Eventually, Don Wilhelms, who made extensive maps of the
Moon in the post-Apollo era, recommended that Procellarum Group
be replaced by the term <i>mare material</i>.  We shall follow that
recommendation below.        
<p>
<h2>Simple Lunar Stratigraphy</h2>
<p>
<p>In this section we will explore some simplified methods of
determining the relative ages of regions of the lunar surface.  They
are not intended to make the reader a professional, but they should
provide a basis for understanding the fascinating endeavor of reading
the history of the Moon by looking closely at its features.  
For simplicity, we include Nectarian materials within the Pre-Imbrian.
<p>
<p><center><i>--i--</i></center>
<p>
We turn first to the time- and chrono-stratigraphic units.  Here are
some general principles:  
<ul>
<li>The heavily cratered lunar highlands belong to the Pre-Imbrian.  The
highlands are easy to recognize.  They are mostly in the center and
southern regions of the nearside, and are light in color.
<li>Mare materials are mostly Imbrian, that is, they belong to the time
between the Imbrian event and the emplacement of the crater
Eratosthenes.
<li>Craters such as Archimedes, that are within maria and have flooded
floors were formed after the Imbrian event, but before the extensive
basalt flooding.
<li>Craters with rough floors or central peaks belong to the
Eratosthenean system if they do not have bright rays.
<li>Craters with rough floors <i>and</i> bright rays belong to the
Copernican system.

<p>We are now in a position to look at images of the Moon and read some
of its history.  The widest divisions may be seen with the naked eye:
the dark maria and bright highlands.  These are the features that make
the so-called "man in the Moon."  It is hard to pin down what people
mean by this phrase, but surely the notion arises from the blend of light
and dark areas--the highlands and the maria.
<p>Highlands, especially in the
south-central regions of the nearside are pre-Imbrian.  Toward the
highlands near the center of the disk, thick ejecta from the Imbrian 
event cover the highland rocks.  Regions near the crater Alphonsus
(Figure 7)
are now mapped into the lower (or older) Imbrian system.     
<p>The dark maria may safely be classified as Imbrian.  The rocks
returned by the Apollo astronauts showed clearly that this material
is basaltic, and similar in nature to the fluid lavas that flowed 
over large areas of northern Idaho and western Washington state, 
near the Columbia river.
These lavas are referred to as ``volcanic'' in origin, even though they
are not associated with large volcanoes.  Some time after the basins
were originally excavated, they were flooded.  It is easy to see that
this must have been the case, as a few craters within the basins
have smooth floors.  A prime example is Archimedes, which we discuss
below.
<p>Telescopic aid is required to see the rough-floored Eratosthenes,
just at the southern edge of the Appenine mountains (see Fig. 8), 
that form the
southern border of the Imbrian basin, and a little further south, we see
the bright-rayed crater Copernicus.  These features may all be seen with
a small telescope or a good pair of binoculars.
<p>Figure 8 shows two juxtaposed photographs taken at the Lick
Observatory near the beginning of the 20th century.  On the right is an
approximate geological map of the region.  It follows more detailed  
maps made by experts (cf. the article by Paul Spudis in <i>The New Solar
System</i>, Sky Publishing Corp. 1999, cf. p. 128).  On the photographic
images, one can easily see the basalt-filled floor of Archimedes.  It
is mapped in blue.  Larger regions are labeled `Im' for Imbrium, 
mare-materials.  Recall that `mare-materials' were once called
`Procellarum group.'  
<p>Extensive regions, mapped in brown, are mapped into the Imbrian
System.  The Appenines Mountains (Iam) form the south eastern rim of 
Imbrium.  Additional regions in the southeast corner of our map belong
to the Imbrian.  A small area, between the crater Archimedes and
the Appenine Mountains proper has been mapped as the <i>Appenine Bench
Formation</i> (Iap).  The chemistry of materials in this region is 
unusual.  The Lunar Prospector detected the most intense emission from the
radioactive element thorium near here.  This emission may come from 
a hypothetical layer of the Moon's subsurface regions that was particularly
rich in elements whose ions do not fit easily into the crystal
structures of common lunar minerals.  This is a fascinating topic, but
we cannot pursue it here (cf. http://lunar.arc.nasa.gov/). 

    
<p>The Eratosthenean System (green) is represented on our map 
only by the crater
Eratostheses itself, and one small crater south of Copernicus.  The
label `Ec' stands for `Eratosthenean, cratered.'  
<p>The Copernican system is represented by the crater Copernicus, and
Kepler to the west.  The rays of Copernicus are not outstanding in
Figure 8 because of the sun angle, but the rays can be seen well into the
Imbrian Basin, as we have attempted to indicate with the gray
lineations.  Kepler's rays are brighter, both because of the slightly
different sun angle, but also because the crater is younger.
<p>Note that both Copernicus and Eratosthenes have rough floors.  This
means that unlike Archimedes, they were formed after the basalt
flooding.  Eratosthenes has no rays, and therefore it is older than
Copernicus.  Two smaller craters to the north and east of Archimedes are
also mapped into the Copernican (gray).  Because of the sun angle, one
can not see their rough floors, but other images, clearly show they are
not flooded.  The upper, larger of the two has a central peak,
characteristic of craters in its size range.

<p>A small area near Archimedes is mapped as the Appenine Bench
Formation.  It belongs to the Imbrian System, and is therefore
designated `Iab.'  Materials of this region have a distinct chemistry
that is shown by the Apollo 15 samples, as well as from recent remote
sensing from orbit.  Rocks in this area may be distinctly rich in
elements whose ions do not fit easily into the crystal structure of the
common moon rocks.  Among these elements are radioactive thorium and
uranium, whose gamma-ray emissions were measured by the Lunar
Prospector.  This is a fascinating topic, but we can not pursue it here
(cf. http://lunar.arc.nasa.gov/).

<p>The layperson's literature on lunar exploration is liberally
sprinkled with references to certain lunar groups and formations.  
While these words have common meanings, or perhaps <i>because</i> of
these common meanings, one cannot fully appreciate this literature
without some understanding of the terms as used by geologists.  We have
therefore been at some pains to illustrate these terms, with the help 
of the Grand Canyon.  
<p>Highly technical terms have a way of insinuating themselves into the
popular literature and textbooks.  They are often memorized and repeated
by students and professors alike, who sound as though they
understood them.  We end our discussion of the Grand Canyon and the Moon
with a summary of some of the lunar materials known by their 
rock-stratigraphic  classifications, <i>groups</i> and 
<i>formations</i>. 
<p>Possibly the most widely discussed lunar formation was named after
old crater Fra Mauro.  With a little effort, Fra Mauro crater can be 
seen on both Figures 7 and 8.  Figure 9 (left) is a NASA image from an 
Apollo orbiter showing Fra Mauro crater, along with Bonpland (southwest)
and Parry (southeast).  A boom of the spacecraft projects from the right;
the arrow points to the location of the Apollo 14 landing site.
<p>

(NASA images).

<p>
<p>The site for the Apollo 14 landing was chosen so the astronauts could
sample and return material from the <i>Fra Mauro Formation</i>.  Because
of the favorable sun angle, it is possible to see north-south lineations
that have been determined to point to the center of the Imbrian Basin.  
These lineations are seen even more clearly in the image on the right,
which is of a region in the central highlands.  
The fact that these lineations line up with the center of Imbrium led
to the conclusion that the Fra Mauro formation consisted of material
ejected in the Imbrian event.  
<p>The smooth-floored
crater that is seen only partially, in the right-lower corner is
Ptolemaus. It lies just north of Alphonsus, indicated in
Figure 7.
<p>Another well-known lunar formation is the Cayley.  Lunar geologists
seem to have a proclivity for choosing small craters to name things
after.  While Fra Mauro is 101 km across, Cayley is only 14, and you
need a very good Moon map to find it (4<sup>o</sup>N, 14<sup>o</sup>E).
This small crater just happens to be in the neighborhood where 
lava from Mare Tranquillitatis joins smooth plains to its west that 
seem to belong to the central highlands.  This is shown on the left 
image of Figure 10.  
Cayley is the small crater appears in the
upper left-central region at the intersection of the two arrows just
outside the image.  

<p><center>

<p></center>


<p>The upper arrow is near the division between the darker
mare material (Procellarum Group) and lighter, but still relatively
smooth regions.  The boundary is easy to follow on the contrasty
image. 
The smooth plains were designated <i>Cayley Formation</i>.  At one time it
was speculated that these materials might be basaltic in nature, and
early discussions of lunar rocks mentioned "highland basalt."  While
the interpretation of some lunar samples is still open, it is now
generally agreed that the Cayley Formation is primarily ejecta,
emplaced, or sifted down from above.  
<p>Superficially, Cayley appears smooth,
and a casual glance at a crater such as Alphonsus in Figure 10 (right)
could lead one to believe its floor had been flooded with basalt 
just as Archimedes's had.  Closer inspection shows underlying relief
that has been covered by debris deposited from above.  That is the
Cayley Formation.  Impact craters, perhaps mostly Imbrium itself, 
provided the sources of the debris. 
<p>We thus find that the Cayley and Fra Mauro Formations have much in
common.  But the distinct names are still useful. 
The materials are found in different regions of the Moon, and have
different appearances.  The Fra Mauro is characterized by streaks and
linear features as though it consisted of material shot horizontally
from the impact.   Cayley material, for which there are 
few or no telltale streaks,  
must have been emplaced from more ballistic trajectories.  
<p>The Apollo 16 landing site was chosen to investigate 
regions near the 48-km wide  crater Descartes that 
had been designated <i>Descartes Formation</i>.  Once again, it was
widely thought the material was basaltic in origin.  However, rocks
investigated in the neighborhood of the lander were highly brecciated   
and similar in composition to Cayley.  While the origin of Descartes
material is still not certain, much of it may also have originated
in the Imbrian event.  Perhaps an unusually dense cloud of dust
deposited it is a few localized areas.  The crater Descartes itself is
filled with the material, to the point where much of the crater is 
hidden.

<p>The notion of a geological groups or formations is not something the
average person thinks about every day.  But the concepts do appear in the
popular literature, and one gains from having a sharper notion of what
these terms mean.  The following passage occurs in James Michener's
historical novel <i>Centenial</i>, 
about a region in Colorado on the South Platt River:  
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#ce008b">
<p>`My good man,' Professor Wright said condescendingly as he kicked at
the base rock. `This is Morrison.  Do you understand that? Morrison!'
<br>`Who's Morrison?' the reporter asked.
<br>`It's a formation! ... It's a purplish formation of clay and rock.  It
exists in a small belt throughout the west, and where you find Morrison,
you find dinosaurs.
</blockquote>
<font color="#000000"
<p>
<p>A large number of geological maps now exist for the Moon, other 
satellites, and planets with solid surfaces.  It
is common for the geologists to give descriptive names to regions
such as ``lineated basin material,'' or ``older plains material.''
It is likely that these areas will become named formations, like
the Fra Mauro or Morrison when they have been the subject of
intensive study.  Certainly, this is the situation for distinctive
terrestrial regions. 
<p>Evidence of life forms in the Hadean Eon have been reported to
exist in the <i>Isua</i> rocks of Greenland.  The Isua is a formation.
We know from the life experiments of the Viking landers, that 
evidence for life on Mars will not be easily found.  But it is possible  
that some day, Martian explorers may report that evidence of past
life forms does exist in certain special rock <i>formations</i>.
Should this happen, the names of these formations will become well
known.
