This introductory lecture places astronomy in the broader context of
science.  It discusses the nature of science, how science is
distinguished from other modes of thought, the difference between
science and technology, and some of the main results of science.</p>

Astronomy has had a strong influence on other sciences and defines the
limits of the scientific universe.  We will illustrate some of the
mind-boggling spatial and temporal scales astronomical research has
revealed in the cosmos.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2>A. What is Science?</h2>

<p>Definition: <b>science is the systematic understanding of empirical
natural phenomena</b>.  </p>

<ul>

"<b><em>Empirical</em></b>" =  experienced or observed </p>

Science is both a <b>body of knowledge</b> and <b>a way of thinking</b>.</p>

Scientific values & methods are relatively <b>new</b> in human
history; started ca. 1500.  </p>

</ul>

Characteristics:

<ul>

<li> Logical; rational</p>

<li> Clear, orderly; choose simplest alternative</p>

<li> Cumulative development</p>

<ul>

 New interpretations are required to be <b>consistent</b> with <b>all</b> established
 facts.<br>
 This is a <b>tremendously challenging</b> requirement!</p>

</ul>
</ul>

Key feature:</p>

<ul>

<!-- <font color=#aa00cc>  -->

<li> Science is based on an <em>empirical criterion
of truth:  <b>ideas are tested by objective experiment/observation in
the real world</b>.  </em></p>

<!--  integrity, scrupulous  -->

<ul>

<li> Evaluation of evidence must be <b>rigorous, objective, and public</b>.
 </p>

<li>Any valid scientific proposition is <em><b>falsifiable</b></em> by
empirical tests.  I.e. it is <b>well enough defined</b> that you can specify
in advance those outcomes that would show the idea to be <b>wrong</b>.</p>

<li>  The results of tests must 
be <b>repeatable</b>. </p>

<li> Confidence in ideas grows with the number of <b>independent</b>
tests or validations.  "Independence" implies verification not only
by <b>different people</b> but also by <b>different methods</b> of
inquiry or lines of evidence.
</p>

</ul>
</ul>

The <b>scientific method</b> in practice:</p>

<ul>

Scientific methods were not invented or prescribed wholesale by
some individual or group.  Rather, they <b>emerged</b> over a period of several
centuries as the set of analytical techniques that <b>proved most
successful</b> in the struggle to understand nature. </p>

 <!--- parallels to development and establishment of British/American
 justice systems -->

The usual formalized statement of "<b>The</b> Scientific Method"
(e.g. Hypothesis ===> Prediction ===> Experiment ===> Interpretation
===> Repeat) is misleading. </p>

<ul>

Scientists frequently simply <b>explore</b> the characteristics of new
phenomena, without any particular intent to distinguish between
interpretations but with the hope that they might prove interesting or
important. </p>

A number of sciences, including astronomy, deal with phenomena that
cannot be manipulated by humans.  <b>Experiments are impossible</b> in
these cases.  These sciences must rely instead on <b>passive
observations</b>. (For astronomy, the only exception is that we can,
with difficulty, sample and experiment with the surfaces and
atmospheres of some of the other bodies in the solar system.)  </p>

</ul>
</ul>


Science as "common sense":</p>

<ul>
The characteristics of scientific thinking should sound familiar to
you:  this is really nothing more than <b>slightly refined, standardized,
and tough-minded "common sense."</b>  Scientific thinking deviates
from "common sense" mainly in that it insists on validating ideas in
the context of a <b>vast</b> store of existing knowledge. </p>

</ul>


<h3>Science and "Truth"</h3>

<ul> Scientific ideas are <b>not</b> claimed to be <b>absolute</b>
truths.  They are always <b>provisional</b>, to a greater or lesser
degree.  They are regarded as <b>approximations</b> to the truth,
subject to revision as new evidence emerges.  They almost
always <b>systematically improve</b> with time, by discarding older,
less successful interpretations.

</ul>



<p><br></p>

<h2> B.  Alternative Modes of Thought</h2>

<!-- Scientific thinking has become so important because
it is tremendously successful in understanding the natural world.-->

It is worthwhile distinguishing science from other modes of
thinking.  



<h3>Idealism</h3> 


<ul>

E.g. Greek philosophy, Plato</p>

Deductions about the physical world are made
from abstract, <b><em>a priori</em> postulates</b>.  It is assumed that empirical
evidence is <b>corrupted</b>. </p>

Fine for mathematics, badly flawed for real world.  </p>

</ul>

<h3>Revelation (religion)</h3>

<ul>

Explanations are sought by appeal to a spiritual realm beyond the
natural world ("super"-natural).</p>

Prior to the development of science, physical phenomena were usually
interpreted as the product of <b>deliberate and purposeful manipulation
by supernatural agencies</b>, with motives largely beyond human
understanding.  Knowledge of these agencies was possible only through
<b>intentional revelation</b> by them.  </p>

By contrast, science deals <b>only</b> with the <b>natural</b> world.
It seeks explanations of natural phenomena in terms of other natural
phenomena.  </p>

Supernatural explanations are not acceptable to scientists because
there is <b>no way to test them</b>. </p>

<!-- they are not subject to the same strict standards of logical
consistency as natural explanations.  More importantly,
there is no way to test supernatural explanations because objective
empirical tests are impossible for the supernatural world. -->

<ul>

Objective empirical tests are impossible for the supernatural world.
Science cannot <b>predict</b> supernatural behavior or intervention in
the natural world since, by definition, the laws of nature don't
apply.  </p>

However, science could in principle <b>detect</b> supernatural
intervention in the natural world <em>a posteriori</em> (after the
fact) because it would appear as a breakdown in the laws of nature.
The fact that discontinuities in natural law have never been verified
shows that direct intervention is rare at current levels of
detection.  Frequent intervention would produce an arbitrary and
largely unintelligible world.  </p>

</ul>

Revelation produces a <b>hierarchy of privilege</b>.  Access to the truth, and
the corresponding power, is normally accorded only to a few (priests,
prophets, gurus).  Non-democratic.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Authority</h3>

<ul>

Ideas are tested by appeal to the <b>pronouncements</b> of an individual or
small group.  These <b>cannot be questioned</b> or superseded. </p>

<ul> The most
familiar, and dangerous, variety of authoritative "truth" is found in
dictatorships.  But authority is also the basis of the case law system
("precedent") in American jurisprudence.  </p>
</ul>

Despite the public impression, <b>science is not based on
authority</b>.  Instead, it operates by <b>consensus</b>.  Any scientist
is entitled to question and retest any idea at any time and attempt to
convince others to change their minds.  Science is <b>democratic</b>.
</p>

<ul>
Scientific "authorities" are respected <b>not</b> because of
<b>who they are</b> but instead because of <b>what they say</b>.
Their ideas are continuously subjected to new tests.  The best idea
prevails.</p>

 Young scientists often aspire to overthrow "authorities" like
Einstein; they almost always fail because their ideas are
not as good. </p>
</ul>

<!--   They quickly learn how difficult it is to understand
nature better.  --> 

 </ul>

<h3>Pseudo-science</h3>

<ul>

Examples: astrology, extra-sensory perception (ESP), psychic
forecasts, telekinesis, UFO abductions, ghosts, pseudo-medicine </p>

Pseudo-scientific investigations apply <b>some, but not all, of
the established methods of science</b>.  They fall short of the basic
criteria listed above in some important way.  </p>

Hallmarks: uncritical acceptance of poorly documented phenomena; lack
of experiments or inadequate experimental controls; inexperienced
observers; logical fallicies; non-repeatability; often self-deception;
sometimes deliberate fraud.  Almost always: <b>lack of consistency</b>
with established principles or facts (e.g. foreseeing the future
contradicts the verified principles of special relativity).  </p>

The evidence is <b>always inadequate</b> 
</p>

<ul>

It is not simply that there is no good scientific explanation for many
claimed pseudo-scientific phenomena.  At any time, there are <b>thousands
of well-documented phenomena</b> that science does not properly
understand.  These are what active scientists devote their careers to
studying.  By contrast, in the case of most pseudo-science the
phenomena themselves have <b>not been demonstrated to exist</b>.</p>

<ul> For instance, we <b>know</b> that penicillin kills certain types
of dangerous bacteria.  But no one has ever convincingly been shown to
be able to read someone else's mind.</p> </ul>

If credible evidence emerges
for any of the marginal "pseudo" areas, they will then receive
mainstream scientific attention.   </p>

</ul>

Most pseudo-science is harmless, except for the sloppy thinking and
miseducation it encourages.  But some pseudo-science poses tangible
<b>threats</b> to you & society.  For example:</p>

<ul>

Fraudulent or ineffective "alternative" health-care (such
as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMGIbOGu8q0&feature=related">homeopathy</a>,
in which the active therapeutic ingredients are diluted to the point
where not a single molecule remains).</p>

False criminal prosecutions (murder, child
abuse, etc.)  based on erroneous psychotherapy (e.g. 
<a href="im/recovered-memory-alien-Doonesbury.gif">
"suppressed"
memories</a> "recovered" by hypnosis).  </p>

</ul> </ul> </ul> 

<p><br></p> 

<h2>C.  Skepticism</h2> 

<b>"Cultivated skepticism"</b> is a cornerstone of science. </p>

All good scientists are skeptics.  This means that they maintain an
attitude of <b>doubt</b> or of <b>suspended judgement</b> about
scientific ideas. </p>

<img align="right" src="im/skeptical-dog-ex.jpg" hspace=10 vspace=10 width=25%>

<ul> 

Scientists insist on the <b>best possible evidence</b> in support of
new ideas.  The adjective that best describes the scientific approach
to evidence is <b>"relentless."</b></p>

Accepted ideas, no matter how well established, are <b>constantly
tested</b> against new evidence, sifted for quality.  All
preconceptions are subject to scrutiny.  History shows that truth only
emerges through this kind of skeptical "scrubbing" of ideas and
evidence.  The ideas that survive this process are very robust.  </p>

<!--  based on scrutiny of others' ideas  -->

<b>Competition over ideas</b>, often intense, is a hallmark of science in
practice.  There are strong incentives for scientists to discover new
phenomena or interpretations that countervail the accepted wisdom.
That is how young people make careers in science.</p>

However, scientific doubt isn't frivolous; it must be based on a
<b>balanced evaluation of the quality of the empirical evidence</b>.
Good scientists are scrupulous in their treatment (positive or
negative) of the evidence; their reputations suffer otherwise.  </p>

Don't confuse healthy scientific skepticism with the <b>activist
"skeptics"</b> who have emerged over the last couple of decades to
dispute the scientific consensus on evolution, global warming,
vaccination against disease, etc.  These groups do not care about the
evidence or hold their judgement in suspension---rather they have
a <b>committed belief</b> in a contrary view. </p>

</ul>

Skepticism based on facts is <b>not</b> an established element in many
other modes of human thinking.  Most people are uncomfortable with
skepticism and instead see virtue in conviction, certainty, and strong
beliefs.  As <a
href="http://www.mcmaster.ca/russdocs/russell.htm">Bertrand
Russell</a> remarked, this may be the "fundamental cause of trouble in
the world today."  </p> 

Errors occur in science, as in any human endeavor.  Historically,
there have been <b>many more wrong ideas</b> in science than right
ones.  Understanding the natural world is hard.  Every scientist has a
long list (usually private) of mistakes he or she has made.  But
because of skepticism and a reliance on real evidence, there is a
strong <b>self-correcting mechanism</b> operating in science: the
errors are identified and discarded.</p>


<!-- Skepticism encourages proponents of new ideas to present the best
possible evidence.

"The fundamental cause of trouble in the world today is that the stupid
   are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt."

<h2>D. Science vs. Technology </h2>

Science and technology are <b>symbiotic but distinct</b></p>

<ul>

<li><b> Science:</b>  Attempt to <b>understand</b> universe, build
a conceptual framework.</p>

<ul>
Adjectives used: "unapplied," "pure" or "basic"</p>

Examples: principles of gravitation, electromagnetism, biochemistry,
astronomy
</p>

</ul>

<li><b>Technology</b>:  <b>Application</b> of basic concepts to
societal needs.</p>

<ul>

Examples:  structural engineering, electrical generators, weapons, 
pharmacology.</p>

</ul>
</ul>

All technology has a <b>societal motivation</b>, whether for good or ill, but
the main motivation for "basic" science is simply <b>curiosity and the
desire to understand</b>. </p>

</ul>

Job descriptions:</p>

<ul>

<li> Scientist:  "be curious"</p>

<li> Technologist:  "be useful"</p>

</ul>

<h2>E. Results of Science </h2>

<h3>Basic result of science</h3>

<ul>

<font color=#aa00cc>  <b>Nature is understandable and operates
according to a small set of universal principles, or "laws" </b> </font> </p>

We may take this for granted today, but it is an astonishing fact.
None of the early scientists who wrestled with trying to understand
nature could have predicted it.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Some other key results</h3>

<ul>

<li> The laws of nature are the <b>same everywhere</b> in the observed universe<br>

<li> All matter, including living systems, is <b>organized hierarchically</b> from
 a smaller set of  subunits<br>

<li> The structure of molecules & atoms is determined by <b>electromagnetic force</b><br>

<li> The Sun is a <b>star</b> <br>

<li> The Earth is a <b>planet</b><br>

<li> Genetic information is transmitted by <b>DNA molecules</b><br>

<li> Most communicable diseases are caused by <b>microorganisms</b><br>

<li> The universe is <b>very ancient</b>, and its structure and contents have <b>changed
 systematically</b> with time<br>

</ul>

<h3>Precursors</h3>

<ul>

Very <b>few</b> of the important results of science had recognizable
precedents in earlier modes of thought (prior to 1500 AD). </p>

The main exceptions are <b>Greek physics and astronomy</b>, e.g.
the models of the solar system by Ptolemy, ca. 130 AD, or the atomic
theory of Democritus, ca. 420 BC.  The Greeks made great progress.
However, they disdained empirical testing of scientific ideas, which
circumscribed their ultimate accomplishments.  See <a
href="guide06.html">Study Guide 6</a>.</p>

</ul>

<h3>How well determined are scientific results?</h3>

<ul>

Some scientific results are known with effective <b>certainty</b>
(e.g. Earth is a planet; only one Sun in the solar system).  </p>
 
But, as noted above, scientific results are <b>subject to revision</b>
based on new evidence.  Scientific ideas normally  <b>systematically
improve</b> by discarding older, less successful interpretations.
</p>

<ul>
You can
picture the progress of science as an <b>inward spiral toward the truth</b>.
</p>
</ul>

Of course, some scientific results are vastly better established than others,
so there is a <b>huge range of validity</b> throughout the scientific literature
at any given time.</p>

Here is a simple <b>practical measure of the validity of the most
important scientific ideas</b>:</p>

<ul>

If our scientific understanding of nature
was seriously flawed, then most of <b>our technology would simply not
work</b>.  The validity of ideas like Newton's laws of motion or
Maxwell's description of electromagnetism is <b>tested
continuously</b> in every assembly line, automobile, and DVD player in
the world.  </p>

</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Influence on society:</h3>

<ul>

As a new mode of thinking about the natural world, science succeeded
brilliantly.  It demonstrated that humans can solve many problems
which at first seemed intractable: e.g. questions like "what causes
bubonic plague?" or "what are the stars?" </p>

<ul> Success in science has been a great source of <b>optimism</b>
in human cultures.  This was a major wellspring for the Enlightenment
and the political philosophies that culminated in the founding of
Western democracy.  </p>


</ul>

Science provides a <b>demonstrably reliable and powerful
understanding</b> of the physical & biological world.  Over the past two
centuries it has transformed human societies.  It is now the basis of
most of our technology, our wealth, and our collective and individual
well-being.  The impact of science on our society is discussed further
in <a href="guide09.html">Study Guide 9</a>.</p>

<h2>F.  Astronomy as a Science</p></h2>

Astronomy is the study of the physical universe beyond the Earth's
atmosphere.</p>

It is the <b>oldest science</b>, nearly universally practiced in literate &
pre-literate societies, and it
has been a major stimulus to other scientific fields from
Greek times to modern physics</p>

<h3>Relevance to society: </h3>

<ol>

<li> Astronomy investigates <b>ultimate origins</b> (an adjunct or alternative to religion)<br>

<li> Astronomy provides our basic global perspective of time & space, i.e. a
<b>cosmic context </b><br>

<li> Astronomy was fundamental to the historical <b>development of
scientific thinking</b> and the formulation of the first generalized
physical laws (Newton).<br>

<li> Study of the other planets and our cosmic environment is essential to
assessing the <b>viability of Earth's biosphere</b> and prospects for
long-term human survival.</p>

</ol>

<h3>History of societal influence:</h3>

<ul>

<li> All societies: practical time- and calendar-keeping, navigation

<li>5000 BC - 1609 AD: aware of solar system (planets, sun)

<li>16th-17th centuries:  astronomy leads in
demolishment of medieval thinking

<li>1609: newly-invented telescope reveals vast stellar system beyond planets

<li>Late 1600's: astronomy leads Newton to his laws of motion, which
initiate the "scientific revolution" and modern technology

<li>19th century: speculation about extraterrestrial life

<li>20th century: recognition of galaxies ("island universes"); expanding,
evolving universe; Big Bang; extraterrestrial cause of mass
biological extinctions; other solar systems. </p>

</ul>

<h2>G.  ASTRONOMICAL DISTANCES AND AGES  </p></h2>

Astronomical time- and distance-scales are <b>tremendously larger</b>
than the "common sense" scales we encounter in everyday life.  </p>


<!--   ADDS S09:
       concept of a billion:  1e6 seconds = 11 days; [30 Msecs/yr];  but
          1e9 seconds = 30 years.  

       more careful explan of scale of stellar struc near sun  
       problem of detecting planets in orbit around other stars;
          Earth orbit: 27 feet away from orange in Kansas.

-->

<ul>
Humans directly experience only a <b>very small range</b> of the ages,
distances, masses, densities, velocities, and energy releases that
prevail in the universe around us.</p>

Unfortunately, this means that astronomical scales (not to mention atomic
or molecular scales) are <b>completely
non-intuitive</b>.  </p>

It is important for astronomers to develop a good <b>cosmic
perspective</b>.  But it is difficult for anyone to visualize the
scales involved.  Because the cosmic range is so enormous, scientists
make regular use of scientific mathematical notation (<b>"powers of
ten"</b>).  For a review of this notation, see <a
href="121supp1.pdf">Supplement I</a> (PDF file).</p>

</ul>

<h3>Example astronomical scale models</h3>

Simple scale models can provide a rough, if never completely adequate,
impression of cosmic scales: </p>

<ol>

<li>Example of the contrast between human perceptions and physical
reality:  the <b>Earth's atmosphere</b>.  It seems enormous and
all-encompassing, but it represents only a tiny fraction of the
Earth's diameter; see <a href="im/himalayas-from-orbit-limb.jpg"
>this image</a>.</p>

<ul>
Can you propose a simple scale model for this?</p>
</ul>

<li>A sample <b>cosmic time scale</b>: </p>

<ul>

<li> The age of the Sun is 5 billion years.  Use the letters in our
textbook to represent this span of time.  How many
years per letter? </p>

<ul>

We discussed this in the introductory lecture, and we determined
that there would be <b>2000 years per letter(!)</b> if the entire textbook
represented the age of the Sun.  All of recorded human history would
fit within the <b>first four letters</b> of the text! </p/>

The Earth is only about 10% younger than the Sun, so our scale model
graphically illustrates the vast span of time over which the surface,
atmosphere, and biosphere of our planet have been shaped into their
present form. </p>

</ul>

<li> The "dripping faucet effect":  the very long time scales that 
characterize planetary evolution mean that <b>small but persistent</b>
changes can eventually have major consequences.  We will
see many examples of these (e.g. polar precession, continental drift). </p>


</ul>


<li> Finally, a healthy, fruit-based <b>cosmic distance scale model</b>:</p>

<ul>

<!-- Fraknoi text uses a basketball-based model. Distances in
that model are about 3x those in the orange model.  -->

<li> Use an <b>orange</b> to represent the Sun.</p>

<ul>

In this model, the Earth to Sun distance (defined to be one
"Astronomical Unit") is 25 ft.  </p>

[Useful mnemonic: Earth diam : Sun diam : Astron Unit = 1:100:10,000]</p>

</ul>

<li> What is the scale distance to the <b>next nearest star</b> (Alpha
Centauri) in this model? </p>

<ul> An additional relevant piece of information that might help
you think about this question is that the Sun is about 10 billion times
brighter than the brightest stars as seen from Earth.</p>

</ul>
</ul>
