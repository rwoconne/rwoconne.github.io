Mars features the most interesting surface of any planet other than
Earth.  Even though Mars is a smaller planet, its land area is about
the same as Earth's (since two-thirds of Earth's surface is covered by
oceans).  Mars' terrain is an exaggerated version of the Earth's.  The
spacecraft campaign which began in the mid-1990's and will continue
through this decade will yield an enormous amount of information on
Mars. </p>

You can find a large number of beautiful Mars images taken by
terrestrial telescopes and spacecraft on the Web.  Some of the better
sites are linked to the <a
href="http://www.astro.virginia.edu/class/oconnell/astr121/guide16-s04.html">
Study Guide 16</a> page on Mars.  </p>

Here, I've selected images which illustrate the variety of terrain on Mars
and the extent to which we are now able to study it from spacecraft.  </p>

<center><h2>MOLA Maps of Mars</h2></center>

Topographic maps produced by the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA)
on the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) mission (now operating in orbit
around Mars).  Left:  Tharsis hemisphere. Right: Hellas hemisphere.
Color coding is for altitude (blue is lowest, red high, white is
highest---but doesn't indicate snow). Click on the images for large
versions. </p>

Identifications for the various Martian features visible here are
given <a href="im/MOLA-w-IDs-seeds.jpg" target=show>here (main areas)</a>
and <a href="im/marsmap-IDs-MOLAteam-2.jpg" target=show>here (details)</a>.</p>

The Tharsis hemisphere is dominated by the <a
href="marsImages.html#plume">"Tharsis Bulge"</a> a huge surface
deformation which produced striking volcanoes and canyons.  The Hellas
hemisphere consists mainly of cratered highlands, punctuated by a
single enormous impact basin (<a
href="marsImages.html#hellas">Hellas</a>).  The cratering density shows
that the Tharsis hemisphere is significantly younger, on average, than
the Hellas hemisphere.  Tharsis is probably 2-3 billion years old.</p>

An even more remarkable asymmetry revealed by the MOLA altitude maps is
the large 5 km (16,500 ft) difference between the mean elevations of
the (low) northern hemisphere and the (high) southern hemisphere.  The
north is less heavily cratered (meaning younger) and smoother.  It is
dominated by a huge, flat depression (blue in the images above), which
may be the bed of an ancient <a
href="marsImages.html#oceans">ocean</a>.  </p>

MOLA map of the dramatic Tharsis (left) and Chryse (right) regions on Mars.  

Clearly marked are the major Tharsis volcanoes: Olympus Mons (18N,
228E), Alba Patera (40N, 250E) and the volcanic chain consisting of
Ascraeus, Pavonis and Arsia montes.  Olympus Mons is the isolated peak
off to the west.  In the lower center of the map is the gigantic
Valles Marineris canyon system (stretching from 265E to 310E).  At the
right side are the Chryse channels.  The large red blotch corresponds

<center><h2>Volcano Olympus Mons</h2></center></a>

Olympus Mons, located west of the Tharsis bulge, is the largest volcano
known in the Solar System, with an altitude of 85,000 feet 
(<a href="im/OlympMons-v-Everest-TSmith-uwash.jpg" target=show>compare to
Mt. Everest</a> at 29,000 ft above sea level and 43,000 ft above the ocean
floor), a diameter of 340 miles, a <a href="#OMcaldera">caldera</a> 15
miles in diameter and flanking cliffs reaching 20,000 feet in
altitude.  If situated in Virginia, it would occupy most of the land
area of the state.  It is a shield volcano, like the large volcanos in
Hawaii.  These tend to have relatively quiescent eruptions of fluid
lava, without the explosiveness associated with ash eruptions or more
viscous lava (as in Mt. St.  Helens).  The massive concentration of
magma which built up Olympus Mons and the Tharsis bulge apparently
originated in an enormous <a href="#plume">mantle plume.</a> </p>

This is a composite of Viking images, projected in perspective as if
seen from an altitude of about 30 miles at a distance of about 1500
miles.  </p>

<a href="im/OlympusM-v-ML-seeds.jpg" target=show>Here</a> is a mosaic looking straight down on Olympus Mons.

<center><h2>Volcano Apollinaris Patera</h2></center>

    This view of Apollinaris Patera, shows characteristics
of an explosive origin and an effusive origin. Incised valleys in most
of the flanks of Apollinaris Patera indicate ash deposits and an
explosive origin. On the west side (bottom), landslides that have shaped
its surface also indicate ash deposits. Towards the south flank, a
large fan of material flowed out of the volcano. This indicates an
effusive origin. Perhaps during its early development Apollinaris
Patera had an explosive origin with effusive eruptions taking place
later on. [Image & caption by Calvin J. Hamilton.] </p>

<center><h2>MGS Image of Elysium Mons</h2></center>

Caldera of Elysium Mons photographed by Mars Global Surveyor with its
narrow angle, high resolution camera (July 1998). This volcano is
41,000 feet high and has a large, round caldera with steep cliffs on
one side.  Several channels carved by lava flows are present, but
there is no evidence of erosion by rainfall.  Some of the craters are
of impact origin, but most are probably produced by volcanic
activity.  About 1/3 of the full MGS image is shown here.  Click on
the image for a higher resolution version (272K).  The full resolution

<center><h2>Tharsis Plume Computer Simulation</h2></center>

     This image shows a computer simulation of processes
in the interior of Mars that could have produced the Tharsis region.
The color differences are variations in temperature. Hot regions are
red and cold regions are blue and green, with the difference between
the hot and cold regions being as much as 1000 C (1800 F).  Because of
thermal expansion, hot rock has a lower density than cold rock.  These
differences in density cause the hot material to rise toward the
surface and the cold material to sink into the interior, creating a
large-scale circulation known as mantle convection.  This type of
mantle flow produces plate tectonics on Earth.</p>

The hot, rising material tends to push the surface of the planet up,
and the cold, sinking material tends to pull the surface down. These
motions contribute to the overall topography of the planet. This
deformation of the planet's surface is shown in gray along the outer
surface of the planet in this image. The amount of deformation is
highly exaggerated to make it visible here. The actual uplift in
Tharsis is estimated to be about 8 kilometers (5 miles) at its center.
This uplift also stretches the crust, forming features such as grabens
and <a href="#valles">Valles Marineris.</a> In addition, the hot,
rising material may melt as it approaches the surface, producing <a
href="#olymp">volcanic activity.</a> [Simulation & caption by Walter
S. Kiefer and Amanda Kubala, LPI.] </p>

<center><h2>Valles Marineris</h2></center>

This great rift canyon on Mars has a length of 2400 miles (it would
reach from Washington, DC to Los Angeles), a maximum width of 70
miles, and a maximum depth of 22,000 feet.  It is vastly 
<a href="im/ValMar-v-GrCan-TSmith-uwash-enl.jpg" target=show>larger than
the US "Grand" Canyon</a>, which would barely qualify as a "side channel"
here.  Valles Marineris was not produced by water flow (although many
smaller Martian channels were).  Instead, it appears to have formed by
a stretching and tearing of the Martian crust during the <a
href="#plume">Tharsis plume</a> upwelling event.  [From Viking

This image from MGS shows a part of the floor of the Candor Chasma
canyon, about 0.5 mile wide.  It contains a number of layers of
material, each about 30 feet thick.  On Earth, deposits like this form
from sedimentary deposits at the bottom of a lake.  This is strong
circumstantial evidence for water on Mars at an earlier time.  If these
are sediments, they might contain fossils of ancient Maritan
lifeforms.  However, it is still possible that the layers were produced
by lava flows or windblown dust deposits.  [Image by Malin Space

<center><h2>Water on Mars: Ravi Vallis</h2></center></h2>

A Viking mosaic of the Ravi Vallis channel.  Unlike <a href="#valles">
Valles Marineris</a>, this channel was carved by water.  The region shown
is about 225 mi long.  </p>

Like many other channels that empty into the northern plains of Mars,
Ravi Vallis orginates in a region of collapsed and disrupted
("chaotic") terrain within the planet's older, cratered highlands.
Structures in these channels indicate that they were carved by liquid
water moving at high flow rates (up to 1000's of times the outflow of
the Amazon river). The abrupt beginning of the channel, with no
apparent tributaries, suggests that the water was released under great
pressure from beneath a confining layer of frozen ground. As this
water was released and flowed away, the overlying surface collapsed,
producing the disruption and subsidence shown here. Three such regions
of chaotic collapsed material are seen in this image, connected by a
channel whose floor was scoured by the flowing water. The flow in this
channel was from west to east (left to right). This channel ultimately
links up with a system of channels that flowed northward into Chryse
Basin.  [Image & caption: LPI]

This is a MOLA elevation map of the north polar hemisphere, with the
outline of the US added for scale. It shows a huge depression which
has many characteristics expected for an ancient ocean bed.  Its
border is level in elevation, like a coastline; terraces run parallel
to the coastline; its floor is smooth and relatively flat, suggesting
sedimentation; it is "fed" by channels running from south to north.
Its volume is consistent with other estimates of the total volume of
water on Mars.  [Image by MOLA Team]

Recent spectroscopic

measurements of molecular hydrogen with the FUSE satellite</a> provide
an estimate of the total volume of water once present on Mars.
This is the equivalent of a global Martian ocean some 4000 feet deep.
The image above is an artist's concept of what Mars might have looked
like when all its low-lying areas were filled with water.
