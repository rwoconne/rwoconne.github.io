All work has now been graded, including the final exam.  Grades
are posted on the Collab/PostEm site, and details on the
grading can be found on the "Grades" link on the course home
page.

         Have a great summer!

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
9 April 2014

Extra credit assignments can be turned in through Friday, April 25.
The Telescope Observing lab will be worth 20 points of extra credit
through that date.  The Orbit of Mars lab and the Moons of Jupiter lab
will be worth 20 points until this Friday (April 11).  After that,
they will be worth only 10 points.  

You can submit the assignments to me in class, to my mailbox in
the Astronomy Dept office, or to a box that will be outside
my office door (251 Astronomy Bldg).  

Instructions for the Jupiter and Mars labs can be downloaded as PDF
files from the Undergraduate Studies information page at:
http://www.astro.virginia.edu/laboratory-information. 

For the Jupiter lab you also need to download a premade answer
sheet, and you will need to obtain software to run on your own
computer from the UVA "HIVE".  See the information page for
instructions on accessing the HIVE.   Alternatively, you can
do the Jupiter lab on an ITS lab computer.

Interim grades have been posted on the "POSTEM" site.

See the "Grades" link on the course homepage for details.

28 February 2014

Interim grades have been posted on the "POSTEM" site.

See the "Grades" link on the course homepage for details.

11 February 2014

Interim Puzzlah scores have been posted to the "POSTEM" tool (NOT the
"Gradebook" tool) on the course Collab site.  The scores include all
puzzlah credit through 10 February.  If you see a zero here, you have
probably not yet registered your iClicker!

For other information on posted grades, see the "Grades" link on
the course homepage.  

Warning!  there is a needless-security-induced bug in Collab such that
some pass-through files, in this case including the actual course home
page, will not automatically display in the Collab window if you are
using a Firefox browser.  To work around this, you must click on the
special symbol that appears at the left hand side of the URL address
window on the browser.  Further information is on the Collab main
page.  

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
1 January 2014

Our first class meeting will be Monday, January 13 at 2:00 PM 
in Clark 107.  See you then.

Textbooks are available in the University Bookstore or online.  You
also need to purchase an "iClicker" response device for in-class use.
Any model of the iClicker will work.  New copies of the text at the
Bookstore include a $10 rebate certificate for the iClicker.  Used
copies do not include the certificate.  You will need to use your
iClicker in class for the first time on Wednesday, January 15.

New copies of the text at the Bookstore also include a subscription to
the "Mastering Astronomy" online website.  That may be helpful to you
in learning or reviewing material in the course, but you are not
required to use it.  Used texts won't include access to Mastering
Astronomy, but if you wish you can purchase that separately directly
from www.masteringastronomy.com.
