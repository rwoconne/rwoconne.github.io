<B>DO GIANT PLANETS FORM QUICKLY OR SLOWLY?</B><P>



After decades of intensive searching, astronomers have found the first
giant
planets orbiting around other stars like the Sun. We now know that
giant
planets similar to Jupiter are not rare in the universe, and exist
around a
number of stars in the Sun's neighborhood of the galaxy. However, all
of
these planets are thought to be about as old as the stars around which
they
orbit, typically billions of years old, like the Sun. These planets are
middle-aged, then, as planets go. In order to find out what these
planets
were like when they were infants, and in particular to learn what
processes
led to their formation, astronomers need to search for them around much
younger stars.<P>



In a paper published in the May 14 issue of Nature, Alan Boss of the
Carnegie Institution of Washington explains that by looking for wobbles
in
young stars, a clear-cut test can be applied that will determine the
mechanism through which giant planets form out of the disks of gas and
dust
that swirl around the youngest stars. Once a giant planet is formed in
orbit
around a young star, the star will wobble back and forth as the star
and
planet orbit around their common center. A wobbling star, therefore,
implies
the presence of an otherwise unseen planetary companion.<P>



There are two ways in which giant planets are thought to have formed.
One
mechanism is very slow, and requires about a million years for a
massive
solid core to form from collisions between smaller ice and rock bodies,
followed by about 10 million years during which the solid core gains a
gaseous atmosphere from the disk and grows to its final, Jovian size.
Boss
has found that the second mechanism is much faster, and requires only
about
a thousand years for the disk itself to clump up directly into a large
ball
of gas and dust that will form the giant planet.<P>



If giant planets form by the solid-core mechanism, then young stars
will not
begin to wobble until they are no longer adolescents, i.e., until after
they
are 10 million years old or older. However, if giant planets form by
the
disk-clumping mechanism, then even the very youngest stars will wobble.
In
fact, Boss shows, the youngest stars will begin to wobble appreciably
even
during the process where the disk begins to form clumps. NASA's planned
Space Interferometry Mission (for launch in around 2005) will have the
power
to detect easily these tiny, infantile motions. By looking closely at a
large sample of young stars in nearby star-forming regions (e.g., in
the
Taurus constellation), astronomers will soon be able to find the clues
that
will solve the puzzle of how giant planets form.<P>



Alan Boss is a staff member at the Carnegie Institution of Washington's
Department of Terrestrial Magnetism (DTM) in northwest Washington, D.C.
DTM,
led by Sean C. Solomon, is one of the institution's five research
centers.
In addition to astronomy, Carnegie conducts research in the earth
sciences,
plant biology, and developmental biology. The institution's
administration
building, housing the office of president Maxine F. Singer, is in
Washington, D.C..<P>
