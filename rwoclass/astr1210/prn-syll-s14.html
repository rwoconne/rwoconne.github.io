<!-- HARDCOPY CONVERSION:  change to black on white; make links
print black; eliminate all figures; eliminate all extra
line spacings (p-br-p format); eliminate add'l paragraph
breaks at end of each table row in outline (adds extra space).

Remove all color specs except b/w. (Some may be OK --- check
   appearance on B&W output). 
Reduce size of overlarge title fonts as appropriate.
Add English names of important URLs
Check underlining on printed copy---modify as necessary; remove
   most link anchors that cause underlining.  
Add emphasis using bold font where necessary.  

Separately, make "prn" version of schedule-XX.html.  
Enlarge table width on schedule to reduce number of pages.

Using browser, make PDF versions of syll and schedule, adjusting
spacing so page breaks are OK.  Make master hardcopies from these.
Use master copies to run off photocopies.

S07,F07:  ran off PDF versions using MAC/Safari;

F12: again, use Safari to make PDF -- because of BUG in PDF conversion
in Firefox (rescales pages 2+).  Had to specify font-face, even though
Helvetica seems to be the default in Firefox.  Had to down-adjust font
sizes to reduce mag factor in Safari PDF version. [! difference
between Safari version running on flash-home and on flash-office.
Home version seems to have different defaults for sizes.  Could be a
parameter misadjusted or some basic difference in s/w.]

F13: based on F12, not S13, version.  Can use Firefox b/c corrected
bug mentioned for F12.  

S14: based on F13.

<h2>Texts and Supplements</h2>

Texts are available at the University Bookstore.  </p>

<ul>

<li> <b><em>The Cosmic Perspective
</em></b>, by Bennett, Donahue, Schneider, & Voit [Sixth Edition].
</p>

<li> <b><em>iClickers</em></b>: we will be
using the <em>iClicker</em> electronic response system during lectures
this semester.  New copies of the Bennett textbook include a 
coupon toward the purchase of an iClicker.  The current version is the
iClicker2.  If you already have an iClicker1 unit, that will suffice
for this class, but the iClicker2 will be more useful for other
courses at UVa.  </p>


<li> <b><em>War of the Worlds</em></b>, by
H. G. Wells.  (Science fiction novel.)  If you prefer electrons to
ink, you can find digital copies of this book online.</p> 

</ul>

Supplementary Resources:</p>

<ul>

<li> Special materials will be posted on the course home page. These
include <b>study guides</b>, which cover all the material discussed in
lectures, and a short set of <b>supplementary notes</b> which will substitute
for some of the reading in Chapters 5 and 6 in the text.</p>

<li> The <b><em>MasteringAstronomy</em></b> website (<a
href="http://www.masteringastronomy.com">www.masteringastronomy.com</a>)
contains a large amount of good supplementary information, including
interactive tutorials, all of which is keyed to the presentation in
the textbook.  If you purchase a new text, you will receive a free
subscription to the site; if you purchase a used text, you must buy
your own subscription.  You will not be required to use this site
during the course, but it may be helpful in understanding or reviewing
the material. </p>

</ul>

</ul>


<h2>Lectures</h2>

<ul> 

Lectures are given MW 2:00-3:15 pm in Clark 107.</p>  

Each <b>study
guide</b> contains notes, illustrations, and links covering the
material discussed in one lecture.  Study guides will be posted to the
course home page prior to a given lecture.</p>

<ul>
Most guides are in HTML format for fast and easy retrieval over the
Web.  To take full advantage of them, you should <b>print out a hardcopy
of each guide</b> before the lecture, bring it to class with
you, and annotate it during the lecture. </p>
</ul>

Lecture Attendance:  I don't require attendance at lectures, so
it's up to you.  But it's a proven fact that students who regularly
attend the lectures get better grades. If you miss some lectures, the
study guides will help fill in.  "Puzzlah" credit (see below) is also
only available during lectures (no make-ups possible).  </p>

</ul>

<h2> Grading and Course Credit</h2>

<ul>

Your final grade will be
determined from a <b>curved</b> grading system with a <b>1000</b>
point maximum possible score. 
The grading curve I aim for is the
following:  A(25%), B(35%), C(30%), D/F(10%).  </p>

The assignment of letter grades will be adjusted according to the
performance of this particular class.  However, the following minimum
point cut-offs are <b>guaranteed</b>:  930 points = A-; 830 points =
B-; 700 points = C-.  These cut-offs may be moved lower if the class
overall does not perform as well as expected, but they will not be
increased.  </p>

<ul>

<li> <b>Examinations</b>:  There will be two midterm exams and the
final.  The two midterms will each be worth a maximum of <b>285</b>
points.  The final will be worth <b>325</b> points.  The three exams
are therefore worth a maximum possible <b>895</b> points.  All exams
will be primarily objective, with roughly equal weight on the reading
and the lectures.  The final will be cumulative but will emphasize
material from the last half of the course.  For those interested,
there will be a review for each exam given outside of regular class
time.  </p>

<li><b>"Puzzlahs"</b>: These are brief,
in-class questions or exercises which you can do in consultation with
other students.  A correct answer is worth 2 points; a wrong answer is
worth 1 point.  This means that you will receive some credit for
simply attending class.  There will be several Puzzlahs offered in each
class.  <b>You will
need to use your iClicker</b> to answer Puzzlahs.  </p>

<ul> 

Puzzlah credit is recorded as follows:  the first <b>80</b> points
are awarded to you in the same way as examination credit.  Points
over the first 80 are awarded as "extra credit" at half
value.  So, if you answer, say, 50 Puzzlah questions correctly,
you will receive 90 points of credit toward your final grade.</p>

This modest in-class credit is intended to encourage you, but not
compel you, to attend lectures. </p>

Puzzlah scores will be recorded electronically based on iClicker
responses. In order that your iClicker scores are properly assigned,
you must first <b>register</b> it.  A link to the registration site is given
on the course homepage.
</p>


</ul>

<li> <b>Constellation Quiz</b>:  All students
are expected to take a nighttime constellation quiz, in which they
will be guided by a TA in learning the constellations and becoming
familiar with the night sky.  A brief introduction will be given in
class. The quiz is worth a maximum of <b>25</b> points. </p>

<ul> Full details on the quizzes are given at the <b>Student Lab
Information site</b>
(<em>http://www.astro.virginia.edu/class/info.php</em>).  The quizzes
will be given at the Student Observatory (outside the
Astronomy Building) <b>Monday through Thursday nights</b>.  You can complete
the quiz in one evening.  The last night for the Quiz is <b>Tuesday,
April 29</b>. </p>

There are two quiz sessions each night, beginning at 9 PM and 10
PM, respectively.  You must be present at the start of your session.
Because space is limited for each session, you must <b>register
for the quiz in advance</b> using the on-line
sign-up page linked to the Student Lab Information site.  </p>

There will be <b>no observing on cloudy nights</b>. Nights within one
week of New Moon (the darkest sky) are best---see the <i>Sky
Events</i> listed on the course schedule.  A telephone recording
giving the status of the Observatory (open/closed, likely observing
conditions, etc.) is available by calling <b>924-7238</b> after 7 PM
each night.  You can also check the weather forecasts and maps on the
Web.  Please note: <b>weather is unreliable</b>.  You should do your
best to complete the quiz as early in the semester as possible.</p>

</ul>

<li><b>Extra Credit</b>:  By doing the
following <b>optional</b> assignments, you can obtain extra course
credit.  This can be used, for instance, to offset a low exam score or
to substitute for some Puzzlah credit.  A maximum of <b>60</b> points
can be earned this way.  You can do any or all of the optional assignments (each
worth a maximum of <b>20</b> points).</p>

Assignments submitted after <b>Friday, April 11</b> will be worth a maximum of
<b>only 10 points</b> each.  The deadline for submission of extra
credit work is <b>Friday, April 25.</b></li></p>

<ol>

<li> <b>Telescope Observing</b>.  Here you will make and record
observations of several different astronomical objects using the
historic 26-in refractor and two smaller telescopes at McCormick
Observatory. You must meet the TA guides in the parking lot outside
the Astronomy Building at 9 PM sharp.  Bring a car if you have one.</p>

Telescope observing will be held only on <b>Monday and Thursday
nights</b>, and, again, you must <b>register in advance</b>.  See the
Student Lab Information site for details.  Instructions and worksheets
will be provided by the TA's, who will also collect worksheets.  No
observing on cloudy nights; call the 924-7238 recording after 7 PM for
information on that night's session.</p>

<li><b>The Orbit of Mars</b>.  Here you will use Kepler's actual data
to determine the shape and size of the orbit of Mars, a re-creation of
a classical investigation which changed the course of science.
Instructions are at the Student Lab Information site.  Requires about
3 hours and involves high-school level math.  </p>

<li><b>Revolution of the Moons of Jupiter</b>.  Here you will use the
motions of Jupiter's satellites to determine the mass of Jupiter.  You
make simulated "observations" of the four bright satellites using a
computer program.  Requires about 3 hours of time, and involves
high-school level math.  You can use your own computer or an ITC
computer to do the lab after downloading the instructions and answer
sheet (2 separate items) from the Student Lab Information site.</p>

</ol>
</ul>
</ul>


<h2>Course Level and Pre-requisites</h2>

<ul>

This course satisfies 3 hours
of the College Natural Sciences Area Requirement.  It is primarily a
<b>descriptive and qualitative</b> introduction to astronomy designed
for liberal arts students.  There are no pre-requisites.  No prior
exposure to college-level science or math is assumed, and you will not
be expected to understand the subject mathematically.  You will,
however, be asked to place your understanding of the subject in a
<b>quantitative perspective</b>. 
For instance, you should be familiar
with the relative sizes and evolutionary timescales of the various
objects we discuss in the solar system.
 </p>

</ul>

<h2>Independent Work</h2>

<ul>

Except for the Puzzlahs, collaboration of any kind on any submitted
work in this course is expressly forbidden.  All work must be pledged,
and your pledge will be taken to signify a completely independent
effort.  The only help you should seek should be from me or the
TA's.</p>
