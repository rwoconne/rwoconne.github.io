<pre>

 This is a copy of an evolutionary/geological timeline that I have
 been making.

 I would be grateful for factual, spelling, and grammar
 corrections. I would be grateful for suggestions as to how to
 better word specific entries so as to make them clearer. I am
 also keen to add interesting events to the timeline and would
 appreciate suggestions.

 Please send any suggestions to me via email.

EVOLUTIONARY/GEOLOGICAL TIMELINE

Time (Myr ago)  Event
                    
4600            Formation of the approximately homogeneous solid Earth by
                planetesimal accretion 
4300            Melting of the Earth due to radioactive and gravitational 
                heating which leads to its differentiated interior structure
                as well as outgassing of molecules such as water, methane, 
                ammonia, hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide 
4300            Atmospheric water is photodissociated by ultraviolet light to
                give oxygen atoms which are incorporated into an ozone 
                layer and hydrogen molecules which escape into space 
4000            Bombardment of the Earth by planetesimals stops 
3800            The Earth's crust solidifies---formation of the oldest rocks
                found on Earth 
3800            Condensation of atmospheric water into oceans 
3500--2800      Prokaryotic cell organisms develop 
3500--2800      Beginning of photosynthesis by blue-green algae which releases
                oxygen molecules into the atmosphere and steadily works to 
                strengthen the ozone layer and change the Earth's chemically 
                reducing atmosphere into a chemically oxidizing one
2400            Rise in the concentration of oxygen molecules stops the
                deposition of uraninites (since they are soluble when combined
                with oxygen) and starts the deposition of banded iron
                formations 
2000            The Oklo natural fission reactor in Gabon goes into operation 
1600            The last reserves of reduced iron are used up by the
                increasing atmospheric oxygen---last banded iron formations 
1500            Eukaryotic cell organisms develop 
1500--600       Rise of multicellular organisms 
580--545        Fossils of Ediacaran organisms are made 
545             Cambrian explosion of hard-bodied organisms 
528--526        Fossilization of the Chengjiang site 
517--515        Fossilization of the Burgess Shale 
500--450        Rise of the fish---first vertebrates 
430             Waxy coated algae begin to live on land 
420             Millipedes have evolved---first land animals 
375             The Appalachian mountains are formed via a plate tectonic
                collision between North America, Africa, and Europe 
375             Appearance of primitive sharks 
350--300        Rise of the amphibians

90              Modern sharks have evolved 
65              K-T Boundary---extinction of the dinosaurs and beginning of
                the reign of mammals 
60              Rats, mice, and squirrels have evolved
