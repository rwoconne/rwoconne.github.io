<UL>
<LI>Because of the supercold propellants in its tanks, the Saturn V gained
an additional 1,400 pounds of weight in ice forming on the skin of the
propellant tanks before liftoff. It was almost all shed from the vehicle
as the Saturn V's F-1 engines ignited and built up thrust before liftoff.</LI>

<LI>During each launch, the Saturn V would generate eighty-five times as
much power as the Hoover Dam.</LI>

<LI>The combined power of the first two stages generated enough energy
to supply all of New York City for 1 hour and 15 minutes.</LI>

<LI>Contrary to popular belief, clouds do not form inside the Vehicle Assembly
Building (VAB). The foundation pilings of the VAB are over 200 feet below
the surface.</LI>

<LI>The explosive potential of a fully-fueled Saturn V was the equivalent
of a small nuclear weapon. With the exception of emergency fire-rescue
crews stationed about 1 kilometer (3280 feet) from the pad, the nearest
spectators were 3-1/2 miles (5.6 km) away, near the Vehicle Assembly Building
(VAB).</LI>

<LI>Fuel economy of the Saturn V was atrocious -- about a few inches to
the gallon!</LI>

<LI>General Motors' <A HREF="http://www.saturnmedia.com/96press/satway/sat-hist.htm">Saturn</A>
line of cars is named after the Saturn launch vehicles. (On the other hand,
my mother's <A HREF="http://www.saturncars.com/">Saturn SL1</A> will nearly
fit inside the bell of a single F-1 engine, and gets MUCH better gas mileage
&lt;grin&gt;! -- CEC)</LI>

<LI>If you laid the Saturn V on its side, its overall length exceeds the
length of a football or soccer field. The height of the vehicle is equivalent
to a 36-story building.</LI>

<LI>During the launch of SA-512 (Apollo 17), the glow its fiery liftoff
and the exhaust plume were visible as far north as Cape Hatteras, North
Carolina and as far south as Cuba. As SA-512 built up thrust and lifted
off from the pad many described the launch as a second sunrise, even tricking
the photocells on nearby street lamps into turning off. The actual, official
sunrise was only but a few hours away.</LI>

<LI>A fully-fueled Saturn V stood 7-7/8 inches (20 cm) shorter than when
unfueled, due to settling caused by the weight of the propellants.</LI>

<LI>During the launch of Apollo 4, sensitive instruments in New York City
picked up the shock wave of the liftoff of the Saturn V.</LI>

<P>All Saturn launch vehicles and stages were identified with Roman numerals.
The correct designations are used throughout these pages. The Saturn vehicles
were pronounced in NASA jargon Saturn-five, Saturn-one-B and Saturn-one,
while the stages were pronounced S-one-C, S-two, and S-four-B. Depending
on which center issued the documents, even the vehicle's serial number
designation was different: Marshall Space Flight Center used the designation
SA (for Saturn-Apollo) followed by the serial number for all Saturn vehicles,
while the Manned Spacecraft Center (now Johnson Space Center) used the
designation AS (for Apollo-Saturn) followed by the serial number in their
documents. Which one is correct? Actually, both of them are, though Marshall
designations are more correct.</P>
