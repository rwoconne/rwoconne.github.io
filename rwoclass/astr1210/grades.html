<center> 5/08/14:  FINAL GRADES POSTED </center></p>

<ol>

<li> All work has now been graded.</p>

<li> The mean score on the Final Exam was 268/326 (82%).</p>

<li> There were 896 points possible on the three examinations, 25
     points possible on the Constellation Quiz ("CQ"), and 80 nominal
     points possible on the in-class Puzzlahs ("PZ"), for a maximum
     possible nominal score of 1001.  </p>

<li> Puzzlah scores were adjusted as follows.  If your accumulated
Puzzlah score during the semester is P, then
the final recorded score (PZ) is computed as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li> If P is 80 or below, then PZ = P <br>
<li> If P is above 80, then PZ = 80 + 0.5*(P-80) and rounded up.</p>

<li> The average PZ score was 80 points.  If you handed in Puzzlah
answers on paper, those were recorded under "AddPZ" and included in
your TOT score.</p>

</ul>

<li> If you did any of the optional laboratories, then you received
     extra credit, listed under "Tel", "Mars", or "Jup".
      </p>

<li> "TOT" is the combined score on all your work.  It equals
      M1+M2+FX+PZ+AddPZ+CQ+Tel+Mars+Jup. The mean TOT score was 856
      points.  Maximum and minimum TOT scores were 1007 and 599. 
      respectively. </p>

<li>  The final letter grades are CURVED, as explained on the syllabus.
      The grade breaks for A-, B-, and C- were all
      adjusted downward from the guaranteed values announced at the
      beginning of the semester. </p>

<li>  You may look over your final exams in my office, but I am required
      to keep the papers.</p>
