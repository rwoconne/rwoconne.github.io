<h1 align="center">ASTR 1210 (O'Connell): Selected Europa Images</h1>

<hr>

<p><br></p>

Europa, the second Galilean satellite of Jupiter, is now regarded as one
of the best candidate biospheres in the solar system because of the
evidence for large amounts of liquid water beneath its icy outer crust.
Here are some images of Europa from the 
<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo">Galileo Mission.</a></p>

<center><h2>Europa Hemisphere</h2></center>

The view of Europa combines images taken in violet, green and near-infrared
filters in 1998 and 1995. The colors have been stretched to show the
subtle differences in materials that cover the icy surface of Europa.
Reddish linear features are some of the cracks and ridges, thousands of
kilometers long, which are caused by the tides raised by the
gravitational pull of Jupiter. Mottled, reddish "chaotic terrain"
exists where the surface has been disrupted and ice blocks have moved
around. The red material at the ridges and chaotic terrain is a non-ice
contaminant and could be salts brought up from a possible ocean beneath
Europa's frozen surface.</p>

Also visible are a few circular features, which are small impact
craters. Europa's surface has very few craters, indicating that recent
or current geologic activity has removed the traces of older impacts.
The paucity of craters, coupled with other evidence, has led scientists
to surmise that there could be an ocean of liquid water beneath
Europa's surface. Where there is water, there could be life. This is
why Europa is a target of current interest for study of the possibility
of non-Earth life. A follow-up spacecraft to Galileo will be Europa
Orbiter, which should determine whether or not Europa has an ocean.</p>

<center><h2>Surface of Europa</h2></center>

The surface of Europa is covered with ice.  By comparison to most
terrestrial planets or satellites, it is extraordinarily smooth.  Closeup
images like this one show that the surface is probably a relatively thin
layer of ice overlying an ocean.  The blue here is ice, and the red lines
are probably cracks, colored by a thin coating of darker material possibly
ejected by ice volcanoes that occur along the cracks.

<center><h2>A Closer View</h2></center>


     This mosaic of a region in the northern hemisphere of 
     Europa, displays many of the features which are typical on the
     satellite's icy surface. Brown, linear (double) ridges extend
     prominently across the scene. They could be frozen remnants of
     cryovolcanic activity which occurred when water or partly molten water
     ice erupted on the Europan surface, freezing almost instantly in the
     extremely low temperatures so far from our sun. Dark spots, several
     kilometers in diameter, are distributed over the surface. A
     geologically older, smoother surface, bluish in tone, underlies the
     ridge system. The blue surface is composed of almost pure water ice,
     whereas the composition of the dark, brownish spots and ridges is not
     certain. One possibility is that they contain evaporites such as
     mineral salts in a matrix of high water content.</p>

<center><h2>Ice Rafts on Europa</h2></center>

     View of a small region of the thin, disrupted, ice crust in the
     Conamara region of Jupiter's moon Europa showing the interplay of
     surface color with ice structures. The white and blue colors outline
     areas that have been blanketed by a fine dust of ice particles ejected
     at the time of formation of the large (26 kilometer in diameter) crater
     Pwyll some 1000 kilometers to the south. A few small craters of less
     than 500 meters or 547 yards in diameter can be seen associated with
     these regions. These were probably formed, at the same time as the
     blanketing occured, by large, intact, blocks of ice thrown up in the
     impact explosion that formed Pwyll. The unblanketed surface has a
     reddish brown color that has been painted by mineral contaminants
     carried and spread by water vapor released from below the crust when it
     was disrupted. The original color of the icy surface was probably a
     deep blue color seen in large areas elsewhere on the moon. The colors
     in this picture have been enhanced for visibility.</p>

     North is to the top of the picture and the sun illuminates the surface
     from the right. The image, centered at 9 degrees north latitude and 274
     degrees west longitude, covers an area approximately 70 by 30
     kilometers (44 by 19 miles), and combines data taken by the Solid State
     Imaging (CCD) system on NASA's Galileo spacecraft during three of its
     orbits through the Jovian system. Low resolution color (violet, green,
     and infrared) data acquired in September 1996, were combined with
     medium resolution images from December 1996, to produce synthetic color
     images. These were then combined with a high resolution mosaic of
     images acquired on February 20th, 1997 at a resolution of 54 meters (59
     yards) per picture element and at a range of 5340 kilometers (3320
     miles).</p>

<center><h2>Ice Cliffs on Europa</h2></center>


     This image, taken by the camera onboard NASA's Galileo spacecraft, is a
     very high resolution view of the Conamara Chaos region on Jupiter's
     moon Europa. It shows an area where icy plates have been broken apart
     and moved around laterally. The top of this image is dominated by
     corrugated plateaus ending in icy cliffs over a hundred meters (a few
     hundred feet) high. Debris piled at the base of the cliffs can be
     resolved down to blocks the size of a house. A fracture that runs
     horizontally across and just below the center of the Europa image is
     about the width of a freeway.

     North is to the top right of the image, and the sun illuminates the
     surface from the east. The image is centered at approximately 9 degrees
     north latitude and 274 degrees west longitude. The image covers an area
     approximately 1.7 kilometers by 4 kilometers (1 mile by 2.5 miles). The
     resolution is 9 meters (30 feet) per picture element. This image was
     taken on December 16, 1997 at a range of 900 kilometers (540 miles) by
     Galileo's solid state imaging system.</p>

<center><h2>Cross Section Model of Europa</h2></center>

     Cutaway view of the possible internal structure of Europa The surface
     of the satellite is a mosaic of images obtained in 1979 by NASA's
     Voyager spacecraft. The interior characteristics are inferred from
     gravity field and magnetic field measurements by NASA's Galileo
     spacecraft. Europa's radius is 1565 km, not too much smaller than our
     Moon's radius. Europa has a metallic (iron, nickel) core (shown in
     gray) drawn to the correct relative size. The core is surrounded by a
     rock shell (shown in brown). The rock layer of Europa (drawn to correct
     relative scale) is in turn surrounded by a shell of water in ice or
     liquid form (shown in blue and white and drawn to the correct relative
     scale). The surface layer of Europa is shown as white to indicate that
     it may differ from the underlying layers. Galileo images of Europa
     suggest that a liquid water ocean might now underlie a surface ice
     layer several to ten kilometers thick. However, this evidence is also
     consistent with the existence of a liquid water ocean in the past. It
     is not certain if there is a liquid water ocean on Europa at present.</p>
