We have been discussing the impact astronomy has had on human society
and civilization.  The quest to understand humanity's place in the
cosmos has been one of the prime motivations for astronomy in all
cultures.  One of astronomy's fundamental contributions has been to
establish <b>our basic perspective of space and time</b> on the
largest possible scales.  It is the only science that attempts to
understand the ultimate origin of the universe around us (in
empirical, not religious or mythological, terms).  The study of
the <b>origin and evolution</b> of the universe is
called <b><em>cosmology</em></b>. </p>

Even though cosmology is not the subject of this course (it is covered
more thoroughly in ASTR 1220, 1280, and 3480), it helps to set the stage to
briefly describe what we have learned so far about the universe and
how its contents have changed through time.</p>

You may want to refer to <a href="121supps2-3.html">Supplements 2 and 3</a>
for background on some of the technical topics included in the following
narrative.</p>


<h2>A.  The Big Bang</h2>

We think the Universe began in a <b><em>Big Bang</em></b> --- that is,
a superdense and superhot state from which it has
been <b>expanding</b> ever since.  The best evidence for the existence
of this hot state is the very faint, diffuse radiation called
the <b><em>cosmic microwave background</em></b>, which is the cooled
remnant of the heat of the Bang.  This was discovered in 1964 by
scientists at Bell Labs, although it had actually been predicted (on
the basis of the Big Bang concept) 16 years earlier.  It was recently
studied in great detail by the <em>"COBE", "WMAP",</em>
and <em>"Planck"</em> satellite missions, and its properties are in
complete agreement with the Big Bang picture. </p>


<h3>WHEN the Big Bang?</h3>
<ul>

A very long time ago.  As best we can determine, the Universe is
almost <b>14 billion years old</b>.  This estimate is based on
observations by WMAP coupled with measures of the expansion rate of
the universe by the Hubble Space Telescope and other instruments.
(The expansion rate of the universe implies an age, since by comparing
the current velocity of expansion to the separation between galaxies,
you can determine the time in the past when they would all have been
on top of one another.)</p>

One of the firm predictions of the Big Bang picture is that there can
be nothing in the universe older than the time of the Bang.
Astronomers can test that by determining the ages of stars, star
clusters, and galaxies.  So far, the oldest of these are about 12
billion years old---consistent with the predictions.  </p>

Recall the <a href="guide01.html#secG">time-scale analogy</a> we
discussed in the first lecture.  We compared the number of letters in
the textbook to the age of the Sun and decided that if the whole text
represented the age of the Sun (5 billion years), then a single letter
represented 2000 years.  So: in the textbook analogy, the universe
would be almost 3 textbooks long.
</p>

</ul>

<h3>WHERE the Big Bang?</h3>

<ul>
When you think of an ordinary explosion, say of a firecracker, it is
always localized in a small volume, and the effects expand outward.
The Big Bang was not like this: in the case of the BB, the explosion happened
<b>everywhere</b> simultaneously.  It filled the <b>whole spatial
volume</b> of the universe. The unimaginable pressure of this event
caused not only the matter of the universe to expand with great
violence but also caused <b>space</b> to expand as well.</p>

This is because, according to the theory of General Relativity as
formulated by Einstein (1915), space and time are not independent of
mass and energy --- space and time are <b>dragged with the expanding
matter</b>.  The space between galaxies is actually expanding.  So, if
you could run the "movie" of the Big Bang backwards, you would see
material around you getting ever more compressed and ever hotter, no
matter where you are in the universe.</p>

As for the volume of space in the universe at the time of the Bang,
the best evidence is that it was <b>infinite</b> then and has remained
infinite ever since (after all, space is expanding).  The universe has no
center, and we are certainly not at a center.  [Yes, this is a difficult
concept---so don't worry if you can't visualize it.]</p>

</ul>

<h3>WHY the Big Bang?</h3>

<ul>
Now you've got us.  In order to answer that question, we would have to
be able to assess the state of things <b>before</b> the Big Bang.
But, as just described, space and time are tied to matter and energy,
and, according to our best understanding, space and time did <b>not
exist</b> before the Bang itself.  There is no way to probe what
happened earlier because our basic conceptual equipment 
becomes meaningless at the instant of the Bang. </p>
</ul>

<!--  VG-1: sketch of cosmic evolution/timescale  -->


<h2>B. Early Evolution of Matter </h2>

Physical conditions near the time of the Bang were utterly alien to
everyday intuition.  Just after the Bang, the universe was filled with
an unimaginably hot, disorganized mixture of <b>subatomic
particles</b>.  The temperature was too high for even ordinary protons
and neutrons to exist, and certainly too high for atoms and molecules.
But the expansion caused <b>quick cooling</b>, and more familiar kinds
of matter rapidly began to "freeze out."

<h3>@ 3 Minutes After the Big Bang: <u>Atomic Nuclei Form</u></h3>

<ul>
At this point, the universe is "cool" enough (about 10-20 million
degrees) for ordinary protons and neutrons to form---the
constituents of atomic nuclei.  Conditions are similar to those in the
cores of stars like the Sun, and so the nuclei interact the same way they
do inside of stars (or a hydrogen bomb) --- in <b>nuclear fusion reactions</b>.
These reactions turn hydrogen nuclei (one proton) into heavier nuclei,
like helium (2 protons, 2 neutrons).  If the universe lingered at this
density and temperature, all of the heavier elements of the
<a href="im/periodic_table.gif">Periodic Table</a> could have been
made.  But it was still expanding and cooling quickly, so only helium
and a few traces of other light elements like lithium were made this
way.  </p>

</ul>


<h3>@ About 1 Million Years After the Big Bang: <u>Atoms Form</u></h3>

<ul> By this time, the universe has cooled to about 3000 degrees, at
which temperature atoms can form.  The nuclei acquire electrons by
electromagnetic attraction from the hot surrounding gas, forming
stable atoms.  But still, because only a few types of nuclei exist,
the gas is mainly only H and He.  This stage is called <b>"recombination"</b>
(electrons "combine" with nuclei) --- something of a misnomer since they
had never previously been combined.  </p>

It is at this point that the <b><em>cosmic microwave background
radiation</em> is released</b>.  Until this time, electromagnetic
radiation had been strongly trapped by interactions with matter (as
daylight is strongly scattered in fog, for instance).  With the
formation of ordinary atoms, most of this radiation is now free to
stream away, even to cross the universe.  That is, in fact, how we we
are able to measure it directly today.  We see that radiation coming
to us from enormous distances (corresponding to a distance of almost
14 billion light-years).  The CMB originates in the most distant
regions we can directly observe in EM radiation; beyond this shell,
the universe is opaque.  Because the radiation has continued to "cool
down" as the universe expands with time, it is detected today as being
at an equivalent temperature of only about 3 degrees above absolute
zero.  We have now detected the CMB coming to us from all directions
in the sky.  <a href="im/planck-CMB-map-2012.png">Click here</a>
for a high-resolution view of the latest all-sky map of the CMB (from
the European <em>Planck</em> mission).
</p>
</ul>


<h2>C. Formation of Galaxies, Stars, and the Chemical Elements</h2>


<h3>Gravity Takes Over</h3>

<ul>

What we've described so far is based on the fundamental physics of
elementary particles, which can mostly be very well tested in the
laboratory.  Conditions like those just after the Big Bang are
simulated in the microscopic fireballs produced when protons or
electrons collide with one another at near the speed of light in
particle accelerators.  Experiments like
the <a href="http://public.web.cern.ch/Public/Welcome.html">Large
Hadron Collider</a> (in Europe) will further test the kinds of physics
prevailing only microseconds after the Big Bang.  The interactions
we've described are based on the so-called <b><em>nuclear</em></b>
short-range forces and the
longer-range <b><em>electromagnetic</em></b> forces.  </p>

What happens over the subsequent 12 billion years depends on how the
basic constituents of the universe interact with each other
<b>gravitationally</b>.  Even though gravity is the weakest of the
fundamental forces, it <b>dominates the growth of
organization</b> in the universe from now on. </p>

Physical structure in the present-day universe originated in <b>tiny
irregularities</b> in the distribution of matter during the Big Bang
which have been <b>"amplified"</b> over the intervening time by the
weak, but inexorable, force of gravity and blown up to cosmic size by
the expansion.  </p>

The next phase of evolution depends very strongly on how clumpy the
matter in the universe is, how fast the clumps move, and so forth.  We
are just now starting to understand this, and the details are not well
in hand.  We do know that following recombination the universe will be
<b>"dark"</b> for a period of some hundreds of millions of years, because the
blaze of the Bang will have faded but stars will not yet have
formed.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Star Formation and Nucleosynthesis</h3>

<ul>

Gas begins to concentrate under gravity slowly at first but then
faster.  The numerous smaller clumps merge into fewer larger clumps in
a hierarchical fashion.  Eventually, the density of the clumps become
high enough for gas clouds within them to cool, compress, and begin to
collapse under their own self-gravity and hence to form the <b>first
stars</b>.  This could have happened anywhere from 50 to several
100 million years after the Bang.  </p>

The earliest generations of stars will consist only of H and He.  But
because they burn these nuclei in their centers through <b>nuclear
fusion reactions, stars create heavier elements</b>, like carbon,
nitrogen, and oxygen.</p>

The newly forged elements wouldn't do much good if they stayed
trapped in stars.  Fortunately, they don't.  Stars like the Sun, in
their old age, tend to shed their outer envelopes, and this carries
some of the heavier elements back into space (into the so-called
"interstellar gas").  Even more importantly, some kinds of stars can
explode violently in their old age.  These <b>supernovae</b> not only
spew most of the star's processed material back into space, but the
explosions themselves generate some heavier elements like iron through
uranium.  Astronomers have recently found that direct <b>collisions</b>
between "neutron stars" -- very dense stellar remnants -- also contribute
importantly to heavy element generation.</p>

So, the stars themselves create most chemical elements --- a process
called
<b><em>nucleosynthesis</em></b>.  These get incorporated into later
generations of stars, which can enrich the mixture further.  </p>

At the end of the chain, elements like C, N, O in turn become the
basis of the <b>organic molecules</b> we find in our bodies and other
life on Earth.  Stars are an essential part of the ultimate human
cosmic heritage. They are not merely incidental celestial decoration,
as they were often considered in pre-scientific philosophy.  </p>

The ultimate manifestation of the inexorable attractive force of
gravity is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole">
black hole</a>, a region containing so much mass that nothing -- no
particle or electromagnetic wave -- can escape it.  Black holes can in
principle form in a wide range of sizes, but the ones we have detected
so far (from about 6 solar masses to several billion solar masses)
have probably all formed from stellar explosions or the coalescence of
stars and subsequent accretion of gas.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Galaxy Formation</h3>

<ul>

The earliest stars were probably unusually massive, but as they seed
their surroundings with heavy elements, ordinary star formation
proliferates.  In the larger collapsing protogalaxies or in collisions
between big galaxies, billions of stars form in intense
<b>starbursts</b> lasting only about 50 million years. </p>

Galaxy build-up continues rapidly for the next 5 billion years or so,
often involving turbulent and violent gravitational interactions
between galaxies that result in <b>mergers</b> between them.  This
era, sometimes called "cosmic noon" because it features the most
intense period of star formation, is being probed in ever-increasing detail
by observations of deep survey fields like
the <a href="HDF.html">Hubble Deep Field</a> or the 
<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2022/nasa-s-webb-delivers-deepest-infrared-image-of-universe-yet">long
exposure images</a> taken with the James Webb Space Telescope.  Star
formation and galaxy build-up is still continuing today, though at a
much reduced pace.</p>

Supercomputers allow astronomers to make fairly realistic <b>numerical
simulations</b> of this phase of evolution. </p>

<ul>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpV-VEv3VUE">
<em>Seeing the Beginning of Time</em></a> is a nice 2019 documentary
video from the National Center for Supercomputer Applications that
illustrates the beautiful work that is now being done in modeling
the evolution of the universe from its earliest moments. </p>

<h2>D. Formation of Planets and Life</h2>

Our Sun formed in the outer parts of an ordinary galaxy about 7 
billion years after the oldest stars in the galaxy.  Several
generations of chemical enrichment had occurred, so about 2%
of its mass is in the form of heavy elements.</p>

The planets formed in a <b>disky debris layer</b> which accompanied the
formation of the Sun.  The terrestrial planets like the Earth
accumulated from solid grains and chunks of materials in the inner
part of the debris disk.  These were predominantly rocky because the
temperature of the inner disk was high.  The outer planets accumulated
from more icy materials in the cooler part of the disk.  </p>

By about 100 million years after the Sun settled down to burning
hydrogen steadily in its center, the planets had assumed their present
structures.  The Earth's atmosphere and surface were very different
from now, and both were subject to violent change by occasional
collisions with asteroids, comets, and other proto-planets, which
thickly populated the debris disk.</p>

Within another billion years or so, conditions were sufficiently
stable and favorable (in terms of water content, temperature,
pressure, etc) that primitive <b>living organisms</b> had begun to
thrive.  Whether these originated on Earth or arrived from elsewhere
we do not yet know.  But the process of biological evolution through
natural selection, which has continued to the point of producing human
beings, had begun.  Lifeforms on the planet underwent a <b>series of
dramatic transformations</b> until, about 50 million years ago,
mammals and flowering plants began to spread rapidly across Earth's
surface.  The human species appeared about 200,000 years ago.</p>

And that brings us (on a cosmic scale) to the present time.</p>

One of the most important lessons learned from astronomy to date is
that there is <b>nothing special about the Sun or the solar
system</b>.  In fact, we already know of <a href="guide11.html">thousands
of planets in orbit around other stars</a>.  <b>Planet-based lifeforms
are therefore probably widespread in the universe</b>, and life could
even exist in interstellar environments.  The universe probably teems
with life.</p>
