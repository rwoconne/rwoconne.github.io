<h2 align="center">Introduction to the History of Astronomy</h2>


The quote above, by Roman philosopher Seneca the Younger, from ca. 50
AD, is characteristic of the views of the most far-sighted thinkers
of ancient Greece and Rome.  They knew that, for all of the important
discoveries about the sky that had already been made (as described
in <a href="guide06.hmtl">Study Guide 6</a>), they had barely
scratched the surface of understanding the sky and its denizens. </p>

Seneca was right about the length of time it would take to achieve
a more complete understanding of the cosmos.  We've presented a quick
overview of our modern understanding in earlier Study Guides, but most
of that was accomplished only in the last century -- almost 2000 years
after Seneca speculated about future discoveries.  That's a measure of
the difficulty in penetrating the complexity of the universe and of
overcoming the limitations of our own inadequate human intuition and
our pre-conceptions about what we might find.  The "things that
are so plain" to us today but would have been almost incomprehensible
in earlier times extend well beyond astronomy to encompass all of
modern science and technology.</p>

In the next few class meetings, we explore the historical record of
progress toward understanding the sky, which began in pre-literate
societies over 5000 years ago.  </p>

<p><br></p>

<h2 align="center">Introduction to Ancient Astronomy</h2>

Evidence from ancient societies that left interpretable artifacts
shows that many took astronomy very seriously, to the extent of
including precise astronomical alignments in their buildings and
ceremonial structures.</p>

In this lecture we discuss some of the ways early societies made and
recorded observations of the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars.  Then, we
explore two of the most dramatic examples of ancient
astronomy.</p>

<ul>

<b>Stonehenge</b>, the striking arrangement of massive stone monoliths
in southern England from before 1500 BC, encodes astronomical
knowledge, but its builders left no written records, so we have no
idea how they acquired that or how they perceived the universe around
them.</p>

By contrast, the <b>Mesoamerican</b> cultures that flourished in Mexico and
Guatemala between about 500 BC and 1500 AD not only documented
extensive and painstaking observations of the sky, but they also left
records of a fascinating, pre-scientific cosmology built on those.
Their vibrant, if violent, view of the cosmos is beautifully captured
in the so-called
<a href="azcalImages.html">"Aztec Calendar Stone"</a>.  The
Mesoamerican Maya culture is an amazing example of great
accomplishments in astronomy conjoined with ferocious societal
behavior.</p>

</ul>

<p><br></p>

<h2>A. Motions of the Planets on the Sky</h2>

A conspicuous feature of the naked-eye sky in the planetarium
simulations shown in <a href="guide04.html">Lecture 4</a> was the
motion of the <b>five bright planets</b>.   Although not
as fast as the diurnal, solar, and lunar motions, the planetary
motions are considerably more <b>complex</b> and placed greater
demands on the abilities of ancient astronomers.  </p>

<ul>
 [Recall that these
"motions" are measured by observers on Earth with respect to
the <b>background patterns of the stars</b> on the sky.]</p>
</ul>

<!--   Disentangling the two types of effects took astronomers a long
time (roughly from 500 BC to 1500 AD).  </p>  -->

As discussed in Lecture 4, these motions are a <b>combination</b> of
(a) the effects of observing from a <b>moving platform</b> and (b)
<b>intrinsic movement</b> of the planets themselves in their orbits
around the Sun.  We will not try to separate these now but instead
will simply review a <b>few key facts</b> about the motions revealed by our
Starry Night simulator:</p>

<ul>

<li> The <b>speed</b> of the motions depends on the planet, <b>decreasing</b> from
rapid to slow in the order: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn.
</p>

<li> The general (average) motion of the planets against the star background is
<b>eastward</b> in the sky.</p>

<li> Mercury and Venus <b>never move very far from the Sun</b> (48
degrees in the case of Venus) and appear to move back and forth in
front of/behind it.</p>

<li> At least once per year, each of the planets halts its eastward
motion and <b>loops backward</b> for a brief period before starting to move
eastward again.  This backward loop is called <em><b>retrograde
motion</b></em>.</p>

<li> The planets are confined to a relatively <b>narrow band</b> on
the sky that is roughly <b>centered on the ecliptic</b>, the annual
track of the Sun.  The planets therefore are always to be found in
the  <b>12 Zodiacal constellations</b>. </p>

<!-- <li> The motion of the planets (especially Mercury and Venus) with
respect to the local horizon can be very complicated.</p>
-->

<li> The <b>extreme north/south positions</b> (i.e. distance from the
celestial equator) of the Sun, Moon, and planets differ from one
another. </p>

<ul> 

<li>  We now know that these differences are determined by the
<b>inclinations</b> of the orbital planes of the planets and Moon to
the ecliptic plane.
</p>

<li>The Sun moves along the ecliptic, so its maximal N/S positions
are <b>23.5 degrees</b> from the equator, as described in <a
href="guide04.html" >Guide 04</a>.</p>

<li>The Moon's orbit is <b>inclined 5 degrees</b> to the ecliptic, so its maximal
N/S positions are <b>28.5 degrees</b> from the equator.  
5 degrees may sound small, but it is <b>10 times</b> the angular
diameter of the Moon, so it is easy to distinguish on the sky.
</p>

<li> The orbit of each planet has a different inclination with respect
to the ecliptic.  A planet's observed N/S extremes are affected both by its
orbital inclination and its distance from the Earth.</p>

</ul>
</ul>

The image below is a time-lapse exposure of a planetarium simulation
of several years of planetary motions over about 40<sup>o</sup> of the
sky, showing the concentrated "active band" and the retrograde loops
of several planets.  North is up and east is to the left in the image.
The planets cross the image moving to the left, except during their
retrograde loops.  The ecliptic runs along the center of the bright
band.  Large N/S departures from the ecliptic are apparent for several
planets.</p>

<h2>B. Astronomical Measurements Without Instruments
</h2>

The most elaborate astronomical instruments prior to the advent of
telescopes were made out of metal and wood.  However, even societies
that lacked metalworking skills could make reasonably careful
astronomical observations using other kinds of technologies, some of
which we explain next:  </p>

<ul>

<li> <b> <em>Heliacal</em> risings</b>: <i>Helios</i> is the Greek
word for the Sun.  Stars are said to exhibit "heliacal risings" if
they <b>rise in the east just before</b> the Sun.  An illustration is
shown <a href="im/heliacal-rising-2panel.tiff">here</a>. This is a
(rough) method of tracking the Sun's changing position with respect to
the stars.  Recall that the Sun moves about <b>1 degree east every
day</b> against the stars.  Hence this is a <b>date-keeping method</b>.
For example, in ancient Egypt a heliacal rising of the brightest star,
Sirius, was used to forecast the Nile's annual flood.  The method can
only be used for stars bright enough to be visible in the twilight
sky.</p>

<center><a href="im/full-moon-horizon-road.jpg"><img src="im/full-moon-horizon-road-2.jpg"
width=50% vspace=8></a><br>
<small><i>A modern example of a horizon intercept<p></i></small>
 </center>

<li> <b>Horizon intercepts</b>: The <b>alignment</b> of a
rising/setting object with distinct features on the <b>distant
horizon</b> as seen from a special location is called a "horizon
intercept."  An illustration is shown above.  Horizon intercepts allow
one to track the <b>date</b> using the N/S position of the
setting/rising Sun against the horizon (more accurate than using
heliacal risings).  It also allows tracking of the <b>motions of the
Moon and planets</b> and, in particular, <b>the extremes of their
north/south motions</b>.  The horizon is a convenient reference plane for
tracking celestial objects; it is harder to provide alignment devices
that track objects when they are high in the sky.</p>

<ul>

Note: accurate Earth-sky angular measurements of this kind require
establishment of a <b>reference direction</b>.  For instance, two
fixed points yielding a well-defined fixed line toward the horizon is
a reference against which to measure anglular positions of intercepts.
The two points could both be <b>natural</b> (e.g. a nearby rock and a
tree on the distant horizon) or they could both
be <b>artificial</b> --- the foreground road in the Moon image above,
for example.  The most sophisticated of the artificial reference
systems were actually embedded into ancient buildings.  </p>

</ul>

<li> <b>Internal building alignments</b>.  Special designs, intended
to assist in making astronomical measurements or to reflect a
recurring important astronomical event (e.g. an equinox or solstice),
have been found built into many ancient buildings.  Discovery and
analysis of such features is an important aspect of a new research
field:
<b>"Archaeo-Astronomy"</b> (see <a
href="http://astronomy.as.virginia.edu/courses"> ASTR
3410</a>).  </p>


Many ancient building alignments were intended to mark the <b>rise or
set</b> (i.e. the <b>horizon intercepts</b>) of important astronomical
objects.  Some examples: </p>

<ul>

<li> The <b>Sun at the equinoxes</b> (east-west alignment).  For
example, most ancient Greek temples have their long axes aligned
east-west, so that the rising or setting Sun illuminates the
interiors.  The bases of the Egyptian pyramids are aligned almost
exactly east-west/north-south, in the case of the 
<a href="astronomy-and-great-pyramid-Fernie-04.pdf">Great
Pyramid of Khufu</a> within 3 minutes of arc (1/20 of a degree).  </p>

<a href="im/kukulcan-on-vernal-EQX-v2.jpg"><img src="im/kukulcan-on-vernal-EQX-v2.jpg"
align="right" width=30% hspace=12 vspace=12></a>

<ul>
The "El Castillo" pyramid, built by the Maya at Chichen Itza ca 950
AD, is not closely aligned E-W/N-S, but it features raised staircases
against which a rippled shadow is cast by the edges of the pyramid
at sunset near the equinoxes.  See the image at the right. As the sun
sets, the shadow moves and is said to resemble the slithering of the
<a href="im/quetzalcoatl-attacking-Codex-Telleriano.jpg">feathered
serpent deity Kukulkan</a>, to whom the temple is dedicated.</p>

</ul>

<li> The <b>Sun at a solstice</b> (its extreme N/S positions).  The
rise/set points of the solstices do <b>not</b> lie east-west, because
the Sun is 23.5 degrees from the celestial equator at these times.
E.g. at Stonehenge, the line of sight from the center of the monument
towards "The Avenue" and "Heelstone" points toward the rising Sun on
the summer solstice.  A number of structures,
e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newgrange">Newgrange</a>
in Ireland (ca. 3200 BC), are oriented toward sunrise at the winter
solstice (shortest day the year).</p>

<li> The <b>Moon at its N/S extremes</b> (28.5 degrees from the
celestial equator): e.g. at <a href="#stonehenge">Stonehenge</a>, the
line of sight over two pairs of special stones point toward Moon rise
or set at the extremes.  For details on the complex motions of the
Moon, see <a href="lunar-motions.html">Lunar Motions and Their
Consequences</a>.</p>

<li> <b>Bright stars</b>.  The rise/set points of stars are always the
same during a given year, but they do change very slowly over time
because of <a href="lunar-motions.html#precession">"precession"</a> of
the Earth's polar axis.  Corrections for precession based on the
date of a given ancient structure must be made before possible sight
lines to stars can be explored.  Examples of significant stellar
alignments with megalithic structures
include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabta_Playa">Nabta
Playa</a> in southern Egypt, from ca. 6000 BC.
</p>

<li> <b>Planets at their N/S extremes</b>: e.g. the
Maya <a href="el-caracol.html"><em>El Caracol</em></a> observatory
building contains alignments of windows and wall structures with
special setting points of Venus on the western horizon.  </p>
</ul>
</ul>

<p><br></p>


<h2>C.  Astronomical Records</h2>

<b>Recording</b> of observations/interpretations is the key to
scientific progress. </p>


<a href="im/babylonian_almanac_cuneiform.jpg"><img align="right" 
src="im/babylonian_almanac_cuneiform-sm.jpg" width=25% hspace=12 vspace=12>
</a>

<ul>

Although pre-literate societies were able to transmit some scientific
information via oral histories and recitation, they rarely progressed
far in understanding the world.  They had a faulty record of their own
histories, let alone nature.  Even crude methods of recording data
provide enormous advantages.  Paradoxically, low-tech stone records
survive better than more elaborate paper records.  </p>

<!-- oldest records:  China, Li Shu, 2650 BC; invention of writing: ca.
3400 BC in Sumeria, Egypt.  -->

The first writing systems were developed ca. 3200 BC in the Near East
(Sumeria and Egypt) and were used mainly to record imperial and
dynastic histories or commercial transactions.</p>

The earliest extant astronomical records (Chinese) are over <b>4500
years old</b>.  The best astronomical records prior to the European
Renaissance were developed by the <b>Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese, and
Maya</b>.  At right is a Babylonian planetary almanac written in "cuneiform"
script (ca. 400 BC).  The script was incised on a wet clay tablet which
was then fired to make a permanent record.  The surviving Maya records
(both carved in stone and written in ink; see below) reveal
sophisticated observational capabilities.</p>

It is difficult for people today, for some of whom time is measured in
minutes elapsed between text messages, to picture the gulf in time
over which human civilizations developed.  Written records of any
kind are sparse before about 500 BC.  The earliest extensive, coherent
histories were written by the ancient Greek
historians <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus">Herodotus</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides">Thucydides</a>
around 430 BC.  For a little context, consider this: when Herodotus
visited and described
the <a href="astronomy-and-great-pyramid-Fernie-04.pdf">
Great Pyramid of Khufu</a> in Egypt ca. 450
BC, he was already as distant in time from its construction as we are
today from the reign of Julius Caesar. </p>


<!--   By contrast, we have no examples of written records from the
Stonehenge or other megalithic cultures. </p> -->

<h2>D. Stonehenge</h2>

<!-- vanished? <a 
href="http://arcturus.pomona.edu/britain/eur-britain.html">  -->

<a href="http://www.megalithic.co.uk/asb_mapsquare.php">
    <img src="im/megalith-map-GB-thumb.gif" width=20% align="right"
    hspace=10 vspace=16></a>

Stonehenge, on the Salisbury plain in south-central England, is the
best known of thousands of <i><b>"megalithic"</b></i> ("giant stone")
monuments surviving from prehistoric times (roughly 3500-500 BC) in
northern Europe.  
(<a href="http://www.megalithic.co.uk/asb_mapsquare.php">Click</a>
on the thumbnail at right for information on
megalithic sites in Great Britain and Ireland.)  These consist mainly
of standing stones, dirt mounds and ditches, and evidence of former
wooden structures, now long decayed.  Four examples are
shown <a href="im/4-megalithic-structures.jpg">here</a>.
</p>

Very little is known about the peoples who built these.  Unlike the
Maya or the Middle Eastern cultures, they did not incise their hard
stone surfaces with symbols or writing, and they left no other records
of any kind.  Consequently, scholarly debate has raged over the
purpose of such structures.  There is, however, good evidence that
their builders incorporated astronomical knowledge of the Sun, Moon,
and bright stars in some of them.  That includes Stonehenge, which is
probably the best-studied ancient structure in terms of its
astronomical alignments and significance.  </p>

<!--  <center><img src="im/EMStonehengeIIIb.jpg" width=35% ></center></p>
-->

<center><a href="im/stonehenge-3periods.jpg"><img src="im/stonehenge-3periods-ex1.jpg"
width=45% vspace=12></a></center>


<p>Construction at Stonehenge took place ca. 3100-1500 BC (<b>over 1500
years!</b>)  in
<a href="im/stonehenge-3periods.jpg">several major phases</a>.  This
was a massive effort, involving, for instance, transport of
specially-selected 5 ton stones up to 240 miles.  The image above
shows Stonehenge as it might have appeared in the period 2000-1550 BC.</p>

<ul>
To put Stonehenge in its historical context, 
<a href="im/civilization-timeline-2.jpg">here</a> is a timeline
showing other contemporaneous cultural developments.  The construction
of Stonehenge started about <b>500 years before</b> the Egyptians began
building pyramids, but the Stonehenge people never reached the 
level of sophistication of the Egyptians.  </p>
</ul>

<a href="im/4-views-stonehenge.jpg">Here</a> are some more views
of the modern Stonehenge.</p>

The <a href="im/EMStonehengeplan.jpg">current-day structure</a>
consists of a series of concentric circular ditches, banks, and
post-holes with a number of large standing stones clustered in the
center and a few at the periphery.  Originally, the large standing
stones were capped with lintels, but only a few of those remain
in place today.  A long straight "Avenue," marked by two parallel
banks, runs north-east from the main structure and ultimately connects
with an <a href="im/stonehenge-vicinity-map-RAS.jpg">ancient
settlement complex</a> several km away.
 </p>


<a href="im/stonehenge-diag-lines-seeds.jpg"><img src="im/stonehenge-diag-lines-seeds.jpg"
width=25% vspace=20 hspace=12 align="right" ></a>

<font color="blue">Astronomical alignments</font>: there are both
solar and lunar alignments built into Stonehenge.  </p>

<ul>

<li> <font color="blue">Solsticial Alignments</font>: A line from the
monument center to the <b>"Heelstone"</b> points toward the location
of <b>sunrise at the summer solstice</b> (the northernmost sunrise of
the year and the longest day of the year).  The reverse points to
<b>sunset at the winter solstice</b> (southernmost sunset).  The Heelstone is
a large, isolated stone lying outside the circular structures on the
centerline of the Avenue.
[<a href="im/stonehenge-diag-lines-seeds.jpg">Click</a> on the
thumbnail at right for a chart of the alignments.] </p/>

<ul>
Note that such "solsticial" orientations are <b>not simply
east-west</b> (which is much more common in ancient buildings).
The heelstone is <b>north-east</b> of the center of
Stonehenge.</p>

A sketch of the Sun's path as it rises over the heelstone on the
summer solstice as seen from the center is shown below.  The stone is
placed slightly south of the actual "horizon intercept," presumably
because one cannot mark that point with a large standing stone and
still see the Sun there.</p>
</ul>

<center><a href="im/stonehenge-solsticerise-seeds.jpg">
<img src="im/stonehenge-solsticerise-seeds-smex.jpg" width=40%
> </a></center></p>


<li> <font color="blue">Lunar Alignments</font>: The so-called
"Station Stones" are four stones lying just inside the circular bank
(labeled "SS" in the <a href="im/EMStonehengeplan.jpg">plan
drawing</a>).  Lines drawn through Station Stones 92 and 93 or 91 and
94
<a href="im/stonehenge-diag-lines-seeds.jpg">align</a> with the N/S
maxima of the Moon's rise or set during the 
<a href="lunar-motions.html"><b>18.6-year revolution
cycle</b></a> in the "nodes" of its orbit.
 </p>

<ul>

The nodal cycle determines where on the sky the N/S maxima will
occur and also controls the pattern of lunar and solar eclipses. 
(See <a href="lunar-motions.html#nodes">Lunar Motions and Their
Consequences</a>.)</p>

Diodorus, a Greek historian during the 1st century BC, refers to
a <b>"19 year" cycle</b> traditionally associated with Stonehenge and
the Moon --- almost certainly the lunar nodal cycle.  </p>

Astronomers Gerald Hawkins, in his best-seller "<em>Stonehenge
Decoded</em>," and Fred Hoyle suggested in the 1960's that the circle
of 56 "Aubrey Holes" (dug at the inner periphery of the circular
mound) could have been used as an analog computer to track the motion
of the Moon, Sun, and the nodes of the lunar orbit in order to predict
eclipses.  56 years, or 3 nodal cycles, is required to bring solar
eclipses back to approximately the same locations on Earth's surface.
Though technically correct, this idea has found little support among
archaeologists.
</p>

</ul>
</ul>

<a href="im/planets1stonehenge_perkins_big.jpg"><img src="im/stonehenge-1.gif"
align="right" width=30% vspace=12 hspace=12></a>

Stonehenge is situated at a <b>unique latitude</b>:  where the lunar and
solar sight lines just described 
<a href="im/stonehenge-diag-lines-seeds.jpg">
<b>cross at right angles</b></a>.  It is possible that the Stonehenge
people chose this site for the monument because of this fact and
that this is the reason they invested so much effort (estimated
at <b>1.5 million person-days</b>) in building it. </p>

Before solar and lunar orientations could be built into
Stonehenge, its planners must have observed the sky for <b>many
cycles</b>---in the case of the Moon, many times 19 years.  And they
needed a method to pass the information on from one generation to the
next (the lifespan then was only ~30 yrs).  No stone, paper, or other
forms of records have been found.  </p>

The most obvious stone structures (the 5 pairs of massive trilithons
arranged in a horseshoe shape, see above right) were constructed last
but have no clear astronomical significance.  </p>

Stonehenge is the most elaborate structure in northern Europe
remaining from the period before 1500 BC.  It clearly reflects the two
most important sky cycles (solar and lunar).  But its central function
is still obscure.  It may have served as an astronomical calendar
tracker, a memorial, a site for religious rituals --- or all of
these.</p>

<h2>E.  Maya Astronomy</h2>

The Maya were the most advanced ancient astronomers in the Western
hemisphere.  They represented the pinnacle of a 2000-year
"Mesoamerican" cultural tradition, preceded by the Olmecs and Zapotecs
and succeeded by the Toltecs and Aztecs.  </p>

The Maya flourished 250-900 AD in the <a href="im/mapmaya-MScorp.gif"
> area</a> now belonging to Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and Belize.
They built many
elaborate <a href="http://www.mesoweb.com/chichen/features/tour/index.html">
cities</a>, including large pyramidal and other public & ceremonial
buildings.  Maya societies had a harsh, militaristic character, and
city-states frequently waged war on one another.  The civilization
suddenly disintegrated beginning ca. 850 AD.  </p>

<ul> The reason for
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Maya_collapse"><b>collapse
of the Maya civilization</b></a> still isn't understood well.  The
main symptom was that the people abandoned most of their cities and
spread out through the forests to live in small villages.  They stayed
that way for hundreds of years.  Something similar happened ca. 1200
BC, at
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse">end
of the Bronze Age</a> in the Eastern Mediterranean, when a dozen
different, formerly interdependent, cultures (including the Mycenaean,
Minoan, and Hittite empires) precipitously declined.  The subsequent
400 years in Greece became known as the "Greek Dark Ages," when
literacy vanished.</p>

A number of problems could have contributed to these collapses:
drought or other environmental pressures, overpopulation, disease,
invasion, or political instability.  Definitive causes have not yet
been identified.  Probably a confluence of adverse natural and human
factors was at fault in both cases.  </p>

The Maya collapse was some 600 years <b>before</b> the arrival of the
Spanish explorers (ca. 1520 AD) and had nothing to do with military
conquest by Europeans.</p>

</ul>

Not only did the Maya empire collapse, but most of their fabulous cities
were abandoned and almost completely forgotten---becoming crumbled
mounds swamped by jungle vegetation and known only to local people.  They
were only rediscovered in the 1840's by American
explorer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lloyd_Stephens"
>John Stephens</a> and popularized by the artwork
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Catherwood"
>Frederick Catherwood</a> (see his watercolor of El Castillo at the

<h3>Maya Observations, Sky Cycles and Calendars</h3>

<ul>

<li> The Maya kept <b>detailed written records</b>, mainly of dynastic
histories but also including <b>astronomical texts</b>, in the form of
elaborate phonetic glyphs painted onto sheets of treated bark or
carved into stone.  Their writing system was developed from an
earlier, cruder, version first used extensively by the Zapotec
civilization (ca. 500 BC).  Regrettably, most paper documents were
deliberately destroyed by the Spanish after the Conquest (1520 AD),
and only a few
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_codices"><b>"codices"</b></a>
survive (example pages are shown above and to the right).
Fortunately, large amounts
of <a href="im/idol-at-copan-litho-catherwood-lrg.jpg">carved material</a>
were undisturbed and are now being slowly translated.</p>

<li> The records show a fascination--even an obsession--with
astronomical <b>time cycles</b>.  Maya astronomers made persistent,
careful observations of the Sun, Moon, Venus, and other planets.  They
built an elaborate and complex <b>calendar system</b>, in which civic 
and religious ceremonies were tied to celestial cycles.  The two major
ritualistic cycles had lengths of 260 days and 52 years.  In contrast
to most calendars, the concept of a lunar month did not play a major
role in this system.</p>

<li> Astronomer "daykeepers" were needed to maintain the alignment of
the sacred calendars with the real sky and to divine the meaning of
changes in the sky.  They consequently had high status in Maya
society. </p>

<!--
 (Despite much speculation, there is no agreed-upon link between the
primary 260 day cycle and conspicuous celestial cycles.)
-->

<li> Despite their remarkable architectual accomplishments, the Maya
had only limited metalworking skills (primarily jewelry) and therefore
lacked metal observational instruments.  They presumably made most of
their astronomical observations using <b>wooden sighting devices and
building or horizon alignments</b>.
See <a href="el-caracol.html">this description</a> of the design of
their elaborate "El Caracol" observatory in Chichen Itza.  </p>


<li> The Maya apparently lived in <b>deep fear of eclipses and the
planet Venus</b>.  They envisioned solar eclipses as a giant serpent
consuming the Sun.  A preoccupation with Venus would be natural for an
observationally-skilled culture because it is, by far,
the <b>brightest starlike object</b> in the sky and exhibits
very <b>complex motions</b> by virtue of its proximity to Earth.
Viewed from Earth, Venus has a 584 day (19 month) cycle of
"configurations" with respect to Sun; the Sun and Venus have a 2922
day (8 year) cycle with respect to the bright stars.  The cycle
features complicated motions of Venus with respect to the Earth's
horizon and other astronomical objects and large changes in the
Venusian brightness.  (We will show simulations in class.)  </p>

<ul>

<li> Venus was believed to be a malevolent god, whose demands for
<b>blood sacrifice</b> at critical times led to <b>ritual murder</b>
by the Maya of both captives and their own citizens, including
children.  (The Toltecs and Aztecs, who became dominant after the Maya
collapse, were even more enthusiastic participants in human
sacrifice.)  The Maya assiduously tracked Venus to forecast the god's
intent toward themselves.</p>

<li> But there is no evidence the Maya understood the origin of the
  celestial motions, which they attributed entirely to <b>supernatural
  volition</b>.</p>

<li> From the standpoint of astronomy, there is an unpleasantly
sinister aspect to this.  The astronomers, or "daykeepers," were so
good at making observations that it's inconceivable they hadn't
realized that the celestial cycles of the Moon and Venus
were <b>strictly repeatable</b>.  And the more cycles they recorded,
the more confident they could be about it.  In other words, they knew
that human intervention made no difference to the motions in the sky.
The astronomers must have colluded with the political and religious
leaders in pretending that the sacrificial rituals were effective.</p>

<ul>
There is a hint of this in the movie <em>Apocalypto</em>.  At the start
of the ostensibly terrifying solar eclipse, two priests exchange a
knowing glance.  They knew it was coming all along.</p>

<h3> The Long Count and the End of the World</h3>

<ul>

The Maya believed in a <b>recurring cosmic cycle of birth and
destruction</b> during which the gods struggled to nurture a fruitful human
species.  Three cycles, each ending in <b>catastrophe</b> for the world, were
thought to have preceded the then-current, fourth, cycle.  The cycles
as interpreted by the (later) Aztecs are described
 <a href="azcalImages.html">here</a>.</p>

Time within a cycle was tracked by the <b>Long Count</b>, in which
each day was assigned a unique number.  Counts were expressed in a
modified <b>base-20</b> system, the longest unit of which was
the <b><em>baktun</em></b>.  A baktun is 20x18x20x20 = 144,000 days
or <b>394 solar years</b> long.  
<a href="im/leiden-plate-photograph.jpg">Here</a> is an example of
an inscription giving a date in the long count calendar.</p>


<img src="im/2012-countdown-calendar.jpg" width=25% align="right" hspace=12
vspace=12>

  Some Maya documents suggest that a
cosmic creation cycle would end in <b>worldwide disaster after
exactly 13 baktuns</b>, or 5125 years.
By cross-correlating Long Count dates with unique astronomical events
and historical dates after the Spanish conquest, archaeologists have
been able to convert Long Count dates to those in the Julian (Western)
calendar.  The <b>starting date</b> of the fourth cycle (and the end
of the third) was determined to be 11 August 3114 BC.  But that
implies that the <b>end of the fourth cycle occurred on 
<a href="im/long-count-date-for-21dec12-NYT.jpg">21 December
2012!</a></b></p>

<!--  <a href="http://www.2012hoax.org/"> --> 

You can find much speculation on the Internet <b>before</b> December 2012
about the meaning of the cycle turnover, including irresponsible
predictions of a looming  
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/2012-guest.html">
<b>Doomsday</b></a>.  A handy "countdown to the apocalypse" calendar
is shown at the right.  The predictions were nonsense, and there was,
obviously, no catastrophe at the predicted time.  The doomsday
hucksters have since retreated into silence to count their money.</p>

Remember that for all their skill in tracking the planets, the Maya
world view was riddled with <b>superstition</b>, and they showed no insight
regarding the true physical nature of the universe or even the size
and shape of the Earth.  They had <b>counting systems</b> but had not
developed mathematical <b>geometry</b>, which would have helped them
understand the nature of sky cycles.  Their writings were vague and
contradictory concerning the cosmic cycles, and some inscriptions
anticipate eras as much as 20<sup>20</sup> years from now in an
inconceivably distant future.  Finally, as is obvious from the
historical record, there was no worldwide cataclysm in 3114 BC, at the
end of the previous 13-baktun cycle.  Same with 2012, and we have now
started the first baktun of a new cycle.  </p>

<h3> Parallel Cultural Development</h3>

Mesoamerican culture developed in isolation from the world outside the
Americas, and there was <b>no contact</b> with Eurasian cultures
before Columbus arrived in 1492 AD.  Maya pyramids and glyph writing
resembled their Egyptian counterparts, but they had developed
completely independently and in parallel and delayed by about 2500
years.  However, the Maya easily exceeded the astronomical
accomplishments of almost all the Eurasian civilizations at a
comparable level of development. </p>

It is something of a shock to realize that for all their
sophistication, the Maya, as well as all the other indigeneous groups
of the Americas, were literally <b>Stone Age people</b>.  They did not
make extensive use of metals: for instance, they never developed
bronze weaponry.  They did not use the wheel for travel, commerce, or
the military.  When Hernan Cortes and his Spanish Conquistadors landed
on the eastern shore of Mexico in 1519, he was facing a determined,
warlike society -- but one of a kind that hadn't existed in Europe or
Asia for over 4000 years.  The result was rapid capitulation of the
Aztec capital Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City) and the subjugation of
the rest of the Mesoamerican empires over the next several
decades.  The same fate befell the even larger
Inca Empire in western South America by 1572.</p>
