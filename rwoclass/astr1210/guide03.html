a universe."</em>  (Persian proverb)</b></font></center></p>

<p><br></p>

This lecture introduces the basic features of the sky which you can
easily see <b>without telescopes</b>.  "Naked eye" observations were 
the starting point for the explorations of the sky that culminated in
our understanding of the universe described in the last lecture.</p>

This lecture also discusses constellations and prepares you for the
out-of-class Constellation Quiz.</p>

<p><br></p>


<h2>A. Culture and Scientific Discovery</h2>

It took about 500 years of scientific effort to put together the
picture of the structure and evolution of the universe described in
the last lecture.  A vast amount of evidence underpins the
elements of this understanding (and the details make up the bulk of
the textbook).  We believe that this picture is right in its
essentials --- so, for instance, when science is taught 300 years from
now, it will still be a valid first-cut description.  </p>

<!--   Progress was slow at first but has accelerated rapidly in
the last 100 years.   -->

On the other hand, our scientific understanding of the cosmos differs
drastically from those of pre-scientific cultures.  This raises a
fundamental question about human societies:  <em><b>Why didn't we know
all this thousands of years ago?</b></em> </p>

More importantly, why didn't we know those <b>other</b> crucial
scientific facts with more immediate practical ramifications---like
the role of microorganisms in causing disease or the value of refined
petroleum as an energetically dense, portable fuel?  </p>

<ul> It's not because of the evolution of the human brain --- as far
as we can tell, human beings were just as smart in 2000 BC as they are
today.  It's not because we had to wait for sophisticated instruments
or electronics to be invented --- these didn't exist in 1500 AD, when
modern science began, either.  It's also not because all earlier
societies were too impoverished to worry about studying nature ---
ancient Egypt, India, Babylon, Rome, China, the Islamic Caliphates,
and the Maya were powerful and wealthy cultures.</p>

Fundamentally, it seems to be because <b>most earlier cultures did not
have the right mind-set to pursue nature with verifiable
methods</b> --- the right combination of a deep desire to understand
the world, objective empiricism, discipline, skepticism, independence,
and mental toughness --- as well as freedom from everyday
drudgery. </p>

And there's another pre-requisite: <b>imagination</b>.  That's a word most
people don't associate with science.  They tend to think that
imagination is confined to "creative" areas like literature, art,
music, and films.  But our scale models show that the dimensions of
the universe are so incredibly different from everyday, "common sense"
human scales, where a mile is a fairly large distance, that scientists
require very active imaginations to make progress.  They have to
develop an intuition for dealing with these kinds of vastly large (or,
in the case of physics or biology, incredibly tiny) worlds.  This is 
a key reason that mathematics is essential, both to facilitate and to
discipline those imaginations.
Scientific creativity is  also needed to see beyond the data,
to sense the underlying reality, and to build a coherent conceptual
framework involving all the related phenomena.  </p>

</ul>

Most early cultures had never moved very far toward a scientific
perspective.   With the striking exception of
the <a href="guide06.html"><b>ancient Greeks</b></a>, they may
have <b>collected</b> a great deal of information about the motions
and appearance of astronomical objects, but they <b>failed to
interpret</b> it critically.  The idea that human beings would one
day <a href="im/Ap15_lander_rover.jpg "><b>walk</b></a> across the
face of one of those godlike, glowing lights in the sky would have
been inconceivable to most early cultures.  </p>

It must also be admitted that our scientific understanding of the
universe, however well-founded, is not congenial to everyone.  The
human race, the Earth, even our galaxy, have no special place in it.
From a human point of view, the universe as revealed by science may
seem cold, dangerous, and purposeless.  It is certainly not the
universe most people had <b>hoped</b> to find. </p>
   
As a contrast, we will explore one of the most fascinating
pre-scientific cosmologies---that of the Mesoamerican cultures that
flourished between about 500 BC and 1500
AD---in <a href="guide05.html">Study Guide 5</a>.</p>

But first, we turn
to the basis of all cosmologies: the study of the night sky.</p>

<p><br></p>


<h2> B.  Motivations for Simple Astronomical Observations</h2>

The concerted study of the sky started long before modern science
arose ca. 1500 AD.  How long?  We don't really know---probably at
least 8000 years before.  Almost every human society whose culture we
have been able to sample in detail shows some awareness of celestial
phenomena --- if not in the form of written records then in other
ways, such as the alignment of buildings to cardinal directions.
</p>

In prehistoric times, astronomy consisted of <b>simple observations
that any interested person could make</b>.  In fact, up to the
nineteenth century most people were well acquainted with the basic
features of the night sky and were able to use them for orientation
and as <b>pathfinders</b> for nighttime travel.  We are unfamiliar with
the sky in modern times mainly because of the advent of
<a href="im/USA-light-pollution-1950-2025.jpg"><b>artificial
lighting</b></a>, which makes it difficult to see the night sky in
urban areas.  We no longer need to use the sky as a pathfinder
either.</p>

Systematic observations of the sky, ranging from crude to highly
sophisticated, were made by many historical cultures, pre-literate and
literate.  Fascination with the sky drew not simply on its appearance,
as impressive as that might be on a dark and clear night, but more
importantly on the fact that things in the sky <b>moved
continuously</b>, some of them in complex ways.  The
mysterious <b>cycles</b> exhibited by the sky denizens revealed the
existence of <b>powers</b> that were (at least initially) beyond human
understanding.  Of course, the dominant object in the sky, the Sun,
also moved in a complicated pattern, and this was important to
understand for many <b>practical reasons</b>. </p>

So, there were several different motivations for study of the
sky: </p>

<ul>

  <li> <b>Curiosity</b>: the most enduring (and productive) motivation
  for trying to understand nature </p>


<li> Important practical applications:</p>

<ul><ul>

    <li>    <b>Navigation</b>: on both land and sea</p>

    <li>    <b>Time Keeping</b>: during day and night </p>

    <li>    <b>Calendar Keeping</b>: for tracking the date & seasons</p>

</ul>

    For early human societies, these could be <b>critical survival
    technologies.</b></p>

</ul>

<li>  <b>Fear/Religious Belief</b>:</p>

<ul>

<a href="im/Aten_disk_rays-v2.jpg"><img align="right" src="im/Aten_disk_rays-v2.jpg" vspace=10 hspace=10 width=30%></a>

<a name="astrology">
<font color="blue"> <b><em>Astrology</em></b></font> as an example.  This is
the idea that the motions of the Sun, Moon, and planets against the
stellar background can be used to <b>predict the future</b> and can influence
human personalities.  It derived from the ancient belief that these
objects are <b>living gods</b>, who betray their intentions by their
movements. This was obviously a powerful motivation for observing the
sky.  </p>

In the carving shown at the right the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaton
(ca. 1350 BC) and his family are communing with the Sun god Aten, the
source of Akhenaton's power.  Claims of special access to the secrets 
of the sky gods were often the basis for authority in ancient cultures. </p>

As our scientific understanding grew, astrology lost its interest for
most people.  We realized that the Sun, Moon, and planets are
inanimate objects, moving in highly <b>regular and predictable</b>
patterns in response to the well understood force of <b>gravity</b>.
They are <b>things, not beings</b> whose motions are wilful.  The
constellations and the Zodiac were recognized to lack physical
significance (see below).  New planetary bodies, e.g. Neptune, were
discovered that the astrologers had somehow failed to detect or
predict.  Statistical tests showed no correlation between "sun signs"
and personality or personal history.  There is <b>no evidence for
astrology</b>, either theoretical or empirical.  Astrology lingers
only as a form of pseudo-science and casual entertainment, kept alive
by popular <a href="im/calvin-on-astrology-1.gif">wishful
thinking</a>.  But it, and related ideas, did play an important
historical role in
<b>encouraging the systematic observations</b> of the sky that ultimately led
to the scientific interpretation of the solar system.  </p>

</ul>
</ul>
                                                                                                    
<h3>Thought experiment</h3>

Imagine that we <b>couldn't</b> easily study objects in the sky ---
that, for instance, the Earth were perpetually shrouded in fog-like
clouds.  In these circumstances, it would have been difficult or
impossible to recognize the regularity in the sky cycles, and
astronomy might well never have developed.  

That would have inhibited the development of related fields such as
physics (e.g. the discovery of gravity) as well and perhaps all of
science.  What kind of world might we live in today if this one piece
of the scientific enterprise had been missing?</p>

In a somewhat different context, the famous science fiction
story <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightfall_(Asimov_short_story)">
"Nightfall"</a> by Isaac Asimov describes the terrible fate of a
society whose planet experiences night only once in several thousand
years.  </p>

<h2>C.  Naked Eye Measurements of the Sky</h2>

<b>Only "naked eye" observations</b> (i.e. without optical aid from
lenses or mirrors) were possible for most of human history!
Telescopes were not invented until 1609 AD.</p>

The human eye is excellent at <b>pattern recognition</b> and can sense
the <b>color</b> and the <b>shape</b> of sufficiently bright and
extended cosmic objects.  However, only a few kinds of <b>quantitative
measurements</b> are possible with the naked eye: </p>

    You will use this scale to measure the angular diameter of the

    </ul>
   -->

   </ul>
   <p><br></p>

 2. <font color="blue"><b>Brightnesses</b></font></p>

   <ul> 

   Astronomers quote star brightnesses on the <b><em>magnitude</em></b>
   scale.  This scale has ancient roots, based originally on <b>ranking</b> the
   stars by their apparent brightness as seen with the unaided eye.  
   Without instruments, this kind of ranking is about the best observers
   can do.</p>

   Today, the scale has been quantified in terms of the light power
   deposited by an individual star per unit area and tied to
   telescopic measurements made with electronic detectors.  </p>

   For the purposes of this course, all you need to know is that the
   magnitude scale runs <b>"backwards"</b> (with <b>brighter</b> objects having
   <b>smaller</b> or negative magnitudes), that with the naked eye you can't
   see fainter than about <b>6th magnitude</b>, and that the brighter planets
   and stars have magnitudes in the range -4 to +2.  See the chart below: </p>

   The faintest objects yet detected (by the Hubble Space Telescope) are
   around magnitude 30, over 1 billion times fainter than
   visible to eye.</p>


   <center><a href="im/appmag-sys-NS.gif"><img src="im/appmag-sys-NS.gif"
   alt="App Mag Sys" width=65% hspace=10 vspace=10></a></center>
   <br>

   The number of stars <b>increases rapidly</b> with increasing magnitude
   (i.e. decreasing brightness): there are only 11 stars brighter
   than magnitude 1 visible from Charlottesville but 1630 stars
   brighter than magnitude 5 and 9000 stars brighter than magnitude
   7.   An 8-inch telescope (a typical size for an amateur scope)
   has a detection limit of about magnitude 13; there are over 
   5,000,000 stars brighter than this.</p>

   </ul>

3. <font color="blue"><b>Time</b></font></p>

<ul>

Even crude measures of angles and brightnesses, coupled with
measurements of time, and if made systematically over days, months, or
years, immediately reveal the presence of astronomical <b>time
cycles</b>, which became the central concern of most ancient
astronomers (discussed in the next several lectures).</p>

</ul>
</ul>


<p><br></p>

<h2>D. Easily Observable Sky Phenomena </h2>

<ul>

<li><font color="blue"><b>STARS</b></font>: About 2000-5000 individual stars
are visible (depending on eyesight) over the whole sky.  About 1000
are visible at a time on a dark, clear night from a given location.
The brighter stars form <b>conspicuous patterns ("constellations")
which seem unchanging</b> to the eye.  </p>

<ul>

<li> The stellar patterns seen in the sky form the backdrop or
<b>"reference frame"</b> against which other objects' motions are
measured.  When we discuss motions <b>"relative to the stars"</b>
below, we mean changes in position on the sky with <b>respect to those
patterns</b> as seen from the Earth.
</p>

<li> Motion: stars appear to <b>wheel in lockstep</b> continuously
across the sky <b>from East to West</b> during the night.  Stellar
patterns come back to the same location in the sky after slightly less
than 24 hours.  The location in the sky of a given star pattern at a
given time of night <b>changes systematically throughout the
year</b>.</p>

</ul>
    
<li><font color="blue"><b>SUN</b></font>: The most obvious astronomical
object (and most important for us!).  Steady brightness.  Has a <b>one
degree per day motion (eastward) relative to the stars</b> (we must infer its
position since stars are invisible in daylight).  It takes the Sun <b>one year</b>
(365.25 days) to return to the same position with respect to the
stars, so we say it has a <b>one-year cycle</b> against the star background.</p>

<li><font color="blue"><b>MOON</b></font>: Bright, but much fainter than the
Sun.  The Moon has a more <b>rapid</b> (eastward) motion relative to stars and
undergoes <b>12 cycles</b> per year.</p>

<ul> 

Unlike the stars and planets, the Sun and Moon have a <b>finite
angular size</b> to the unaided eye.  The stars and planets appear
only as <b>unresolved points of light</b>.</p>

The Moon exhibits  a <b>drastic change</b> in brightness and
<em><b>phase</b></em> (bright part as a fraction of a full circle) during
each cycle.  It takes the Moon 29.5 days to return to the same phase (e.g.
"full").  This is the cycle we have formalized in our calendar as the
<b>month</b> ("moonth").</p>

Note: Moonlight was of <b>enormous practical value</b> for nighttime
activities before electrical lighting was invented, so the phases of the
Moon were closely followed in earlier times.</p>

</ul>

<li><font color="blue"><b>PLANETS</b></font>: Less obvious.  <b>5 bright,
starlike objects exhibiting slow, complex motions</b> relative to the stars.
Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn.  Two of these (Mercury, Venus)
are always found relatively near the Sun; others can be up to 180 degrees
away.  Large brightness changes are exhibited by the first three listed. </p>

</ul>

Other, less conspicuous, phenomena:</p>

<ul><ul>

<li><font color="blue"><b>METEORS</b></font>:  brief streaks of light in the sky;
typically 5-10 per hour but occasionally occur in "showers." </p>

<li> <font color="blue"><b>COMETS</b></font>: occasional (once every few
years) flamelike objects moving slowly through the sky over several
weeks. </p>

<li> <font color="blue"><b>THE MILKY WAY</b></font>: a diffuse, irregular
band of faint light that circles the sky, best seen in the evening
July-September, is the plane of our galaxy (described
in <a href="guide02.html">Guide 2</a>), viewed edge-on.  Billions of
stars contribute to the light of the Milky Way.  You can resolve the
brighter of these with a pair of binoculars, but only large telescopes
<a href="http://rwoconne.uvacreate.virginia.edu/MW-bulge-SWEEPS-field-hst.jpg">
reveal them</a> in their multitudes.</p>

</ul></ul>

We will illustrate the bright objects in the sky and their main
motions in class using a computer sky simulation program called <em><a
href="http://www.starrynight.com" > Starry Night</a></em>.</p>

<h3>Interference: sky brightness</h3>

<ul>

Your view of the sky is strongly affected by <b>background sky
light</b>, both natural and man-made. During the day, Sunlight
scattered by molecules in the Earth's atmosphere produces the bright
"blue sky" that <b>completely shields</b> almost all cosmic objects
from our eyesight.  Near full Moon, only the brightest objects are
visible in the night sky because of atmospheric scattering of
Moonlight. City lights create enough
local <a href="im/USA-light-pollution-1950-2025.jpg">"light
pollution"</a> to rival or exceed the effects of the full Moon, even
when the sky would be naturally dark.  Sadly, most people today have
never experienced a view of the dark sky as it would have appeared to
ancient astronomers.  (In fact, during some recent urban power
failures, <a href="im/LA-power-failure-MW-1990s.jpg">people called the
police to report the "strange things" in the sky!</a>) </p>

</ul>

<p><br></p>

<a href="im/loc-refsys-NS.gif"><img src="im/loc-refsys-NS.gif"
alt="Celestial Sphere" width=40%></center></a>


<h2> E. The Celestial Sphere</h2>  

<ul> 

<li> The <em>Celestial Sphere (CS)</em> is a <b>geometrical construct</b> on
which to display the angular positions of astronomical objects.  See
the image above.</p>

<li> It is an <b>imaginary hollow sphere</b> centered on Earth.  It is
shown shaded in the illustration above.  Directions to key orienting
positions and to each astronomical object are imagined to be marked on
the surface of the sphere.</p>

<li> The <b><em>horizon plane</em></b> is the (idealized) plane "tangent"
to (just touching) the Earth at your location.  You can see objects
<b>above</b> the plane but not below.  The horizon will be discussed
further in the <a href="guide04.html">next lecture.</a></p>

<li> The <b><em>zenith</em></b> is the point on the sphere perpendicular
to your horizon plane (i.e. "directly overhead").</p>

<li> The <b><em>north & south celestial poles</em></b>: the points on
the sky directly "over" Earth's poles.  They are the points where the
projections of Earth's rotation axis pierce the CS.  These are fixed
points.  </p>

<li> The <b><em>celestial equator</em></b>: the outward projection of Earth's
equator to the sphere. </p>

<li> Astronomical <b>coordinate systems</b> are based on measuring angular
distances along the celestial sphere from the poles, equator, and other
reference points to astronomical objects (similar to geographical
latitude and longitude).  </p>

<h2> F. Constellations</h2>

The stars are not uniformly distributed on the sky.
Many of the brighter stars form conspicuous <b>patterns</b>.
To the eye, the patterns seem unchanging, with the stars
<b>"fixed"</b> relative to one another.  The patterns are very useful
for orientation, navigation, determining time of night, date, etc.,
and so were given <b>names</b>.  </p>

<ul>
 The human brain is wired for this kind of pattern
 recognition: people who could recognize the tiger lurking in the

Each named pattern is called a <b><em>constellation</em></b>.  It was
natural for people to seek deeper meaning in these remote, silent, but
majestic figures at the limit of the visible world.  So, the
constellations often were given important <b>mythological or religious
associations</b>.  Some have traditionally been associated with
animals, instruments and other features from the natural or human
worlds.  An example of the figures and star outlines associated with
"Orion the hunter," "Taurus the bull," and "Lepus the hare" is shown
at the right (click for enlargement). </p>

Constellation associations are strongly culture-dependent, and the
same patterns can have very different interpretations in different
cultures.  For the brighter constellations we recognize today,
mythological contexts often date back to Greek and Roman times.  The
compilation of stellar observations by Greek astronomer Claudius
Ptolemy in his <em>Almagest</em> (ca. 160 AD) includes 47 of today's
88 constellations.  Some associations are even more ancient, going
back to around 2000 BC (Leo the lion, Scorpio the scorpion).  Some are
new since 1700 AD (e.g. Microscopium).  Few resemble their namesake closely.
Classical atlases showing artists' visualizations of the traditional
associations can be elaborate & beautiful (see the illustration of the
north polar constellations from an atlas by Cellerius shown
below).</p>

<h3>Functions of the constellations?</h3>

<ul>

The associations had at least two functions: (1) as a <b>mnemonic</b> for
remembering the patterns that served as important aids for navigation or
time-keeping; (2) as religious or mythological <b>symbols</b> of
meaning in nature.</p>

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac"><b><em>Zodiac</em></b></a>
is a set of constellations that were usually assigned greater
importance.  These are the constellations <b>through which the Sun
appears to move</b> in the course of a year and through which
the <b>Moon</b> appears to move in a month.  In the traditional form
there were 12 Zodiacal constellations, one corresponding to each
month.  (According to the modern boundaries of the constellations,
however, the Sun also passes through a 13th: Ophiuchus.) </p>

<ul>
Because the Zodiacal constellations provide a means of tracking the
date, they assumed great importance
in <a href="#astrology">astrology</a> and predictions of the future
using horoscopes, where a person's "sun sign" is defined by the
constellation the Sun is in at the time of their birth. </p>

</ul>

</ul>

<h3>Significance of the constellations?</h3>

<ol>

<li> <b>They have no physical significance.</b></p>

<ul> The associations are arbitrary and <b>man-made</b>.  Constellations are
<b>not natural groups</b> of stars.  The fainter stars in a
constellation don't follow the pattern of the brighter ones.  Stars in
a given constellation lie near the same line of sight as viewed from
Earth but are <b>not necessarily close to one another</b> in
space.  <a href="im/orion-sky-projection-exl.jpg" > Click here</a> for
an illustration in the case of Orion.</p>

The shapes are <b>specific to Earth's location</b> in 3-D space (a fact not
recognized when ancient astrological systems were developed which
attached significance to the shapes).</p> </ul>

<li> Although the eye could not detect the motions except over 1000's
of years, <b>all stars are moving</b> with respect to one another.
Therefore, the <b>constellation patterns are transitory.</b> The
changing appearance of the "Big Dipper" now and 100,000 years from now
is shown below.  <a href="im/proper_motion_big_dipper.gif">Here is
a GIF animation</a> of the motion of the Big Dipper stars over 200,000
years. </p>

<li> There are now 88 "official" constellations.  Astronomers use
constellations mainly as a convenience to roughly locate objects in the
sky, like a ZIP code.  They are, however, important for orienting
yourself in the night sky when you observe it with the naked eye,
binoculars, or small telescopes.  They can also help you determine
geographic directions and the time of night.  </p>

<h2>G. Doing the Constellation Quiz</h2>

<ul>  

<li> The procedure is explained on the <a
 href="http://astronomy.as.virginia.edu/laboratory-information">Student Lab
 Information</a> page.<br>

<li> No preparation is required (beyond reading this Study Guide).<br>

<li> It is better to write your answers in pencil than ink.  Bring
a red flashlight and a clipboard if you can. <br>

<li> Remember that there are two sessions each night, Mondays through
Thursdays, but that you must <b>reserve</b> a place in a session
ahead of time.<br>

<li>Be at <a href="https://astronomy.as.virginia.edu/laboratory-information" >the Student
Observatory</a> adjacent to the Astronomy Building by the starting
time.<br>

<li>Don't wait until the end of the semester! Clear skies are always at a
premium. <br>

<li>Best is a night without a bright Moon (see <a
href="sched-s14.html"> the list of sky events</a>). </p>

<li>Tips for recognizing constellations:</p>

<ul>

<li> Locate the <a href="im/dippers_JLodriguss.jpg" >Big
and Little Dippers</a> (officially in Ursa Major and Ursa Minor,
respectively).  Then find Polaris, the North Star, at the end of the
handle of the Little Dipper.  This allows you to 
orient yourself N/S/E/W. (See below), <br>

<li> Use a star map & pattern recognition to "hop" to other bright stars.
Use brighter, more conspicuous constellations (e.g. Orion) to
locate others.<br>

<li> Warning! the scales and brightnesses of objects in the sky are
NOT well represented on any printed map.  Be prepared to adjust your
perspective when you look at the real sky.<br>

<li>Use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averted_vision"><em>averted
vision</em></a> to find fainter objects: rather than looking directly at
the target, stare about 20 degrees away, but concentrate on the target's
location.  Light pollution is a serious problem in
Charlottesville.<br>

Puzzlah preparation optional exercise:</p>

<ul> "Sun block" experiment: Measure the <b>angular diameter of the
Sun</b> as follows.  You can do this on any day (clear or partly
cloudy) when you can see the disk of the Sun.  Don't look directly at
the sun.  Instead put your hand (palm out & fingers together) in front
of your eyes at arm's length.  Close one eye. Then, carefully fold
down fingers, keeping the Sun's light covered until you can't remove
any more fingers without letting sunlight pass.  Remember that your
index finger will subtend about 1 degree in width when held at arm's
length.</p>

<ul>

  <li> How wide is the Sun in degrees? </p>

 <!-- 
  <li> Repeat this exercise for the star cluster the Pleiades viewed on
      a clear night.  Which is larger, the Sun or the Pleiades?</p>
   -->


 <!--  If the whole sky (both hemispheres) covers 41,000 square degrees, how
 many times over could you fit the Sun's apparent disk into the whole
 sky?  -->  
</ul>

Work alone or in a group, as you wish, and be ready with your answers
