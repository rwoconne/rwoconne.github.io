<h1 align="center"> PUZZLAH PREP: LECTURE 5 </b> </h1>

<p><br></p>

These puzzlah-prep questions relate to topics that might form
the basis of in-class puzzlah questions for a given lecture.
Consider them while reading over the Study Guide and reading
assignment.</p>

The topics are <u>not guaranteed</u> to be included as puzzlahs, nor
would a puzzlah necessarily be formulated as are the questions
here.</p>

<p><br></p>

<ul>

Lecture 5 will <b>not cover</b> the material on lunar phases,
precession and eclipses (i.e. the material on the
page <a href="lunar-motions.html"><em>Lunar Motions and Their
Consequences</em></a>).  However, <b>there will be puzzlah questions</b> on
this material, so you should pay more attention to the reading
assignment than usual.  The questions below point out some of the
features that will be covered:</p>

<h3>

On how many days during the month is the Moon as seen from Earth
exactly half-illuminated by the Sun?</p>

<ul>
   (A) 1; (B) 2; (C) 4; (D) 30 days (i.e. always)  </p>
</ul>

(T/F) On a night when the Moon is "full", it will be seen rising in
the east just as the Sun is setting in the west.  [<em>Hint: study
the figure in Sec. A of "Lunar Motions." .</em>]</p>

(T/F) Polaris is now, and will always be, the "north pole star."  </p>

If a total lunar eclipse occurs tonight, how long will it be until
the Moon is seen in the "new" phase?</p>

<ul>
   (A) 1 day; (B) 7 days; (C) 14 days; (D) 30 days.  </p>
</ul>

<!-- added 7/2018: -->

In the movie <em>Apocalypto</em> there is a full Moon on the night
after a total solar eclipse.  How often does this happen in real
life? </p>

<ul>

(A) Every month; (B) About every 6 months; (C) Never. 
</ul>


</h3>
