people tend to talk of "Martians", rather than, say, Saturnians or
Jovians, when the topic of extraterrestrial life is broached?
Historically, Mars was thought to be the most likely of the planets to
harbor life. Popular culture in the form of literature, and then later
radio and film, reflected such beliefs. Public fascination with Martians
began in the late 19th century when, in 1877, astronomer Giovanni
Sciaparelli reported observations of large <i>canali</i> (meaning
"channels") on Mars. Unfortunately, the term "canali" was mistranslated
as "canals" in English. The Suez Canal, an engineering marvel of its
time, had just been completed in 1869, and to some people innovative,
technological Martians were implicated. In 1897, H. G. Wells' <i>The War
of the Worlds</i> was the first major work to explore the concept of the
"extraterrestrial invader" and exerted a considerable influence on the
public psyche. A few years later, even astronomers such as <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030604153609/http://www.lowell.edu/AboutLowell/plowell.html"> Percival Lowell</a>
seriously countenanced the possibility of advanced lifeforms as
described in his book <i>Mars as the Abode of Life</i> (1910).
Consequently, Mars began to take a special place in popular culture
around the turn of the 20th century which has continued to this day. Of
course, this is not to belittle the unique role Mars has also played in
the history of science: in particular, the recorded movement of Mars led
Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) to formulate his three <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030604153609/http://home.cvc.org/science/kepler.htm"> laws of
planetary motion </a> (two in 1609 and the third in 1618) which
shattered medieval, anthropocentric notions of astronomy and laid the
foundations for the discoveries of Isaac Newton (1643-1727). <br> In
this fun and educational page, we take a look at Mars in literature,
radio and film. We see how it is that Mars has inspired human
imagination, sometimes in rather peculiar ways.  <p> <img src="mars-in-popular-culture_files/colorbar.gif"></p></td> </tr></tbody></table></center>

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030604153609/http://swc2.hccs.cc.tx.us/htmls/rowhtml/swift/Swift.html">
Jonathan Swift </a> (1667-1745), the great Irish writer and satirist
makes a very curious reference to Mars' satellites in <i>Gulliver's
Travels</i>.  In the book, astronomers on the fictional island of Laputa
(the king of which is fond of solving mathematical problems) are said to
have discovered two satellites around Mars, and Swift even details the
orbital mechanics with reference to Kepler's laws. In fact, the two
Martian satellites (Phobos, the inner satellite, and Deimos, the outer
one) were not discovered until 1877 by the American astronomer Asaph
Hall. Was the assumption of two satellites just a lucky guess on Swift's
part? And was it also coincidental that he correctly guessed that the
inner satellite orbited Mars in less than a day?  Phobos actually has an
orbital period of 0.32 of a day and Deimos 1.26 of a day with radial
(semimajor axis) distances from Mars of 9379 km and 23459 km,
respectively. (Mars has a mean diameter of 6780 km.) Actually, Swift was
almost certainly aware of Kepler's speculation that Mars had two
moons. Kepler based this on naive mathematical intuition: because Venus
had no moon and Earth had one moon, it somehow implied that Mars must
have two moons as an outwards progression from the sun.<br><br>

Part III, Chapter 3:<br><font color="white">"[The astronomers]..have
likewise discovered two lesser stars, or satellites, which revolve about
Mars, whereof the innermost is distant from the center of the primary
planet exactly three of his diameters, and the outermost five; the
former revolves in the space of ten hours, and the latter in twenty-one
and a half; so that the squares of their periodical times are very near
in the same proportion with the cubes of their distance from the center
of Mars, which evidently shows them to be governed by the same law of
gravitation that influences the other heavenly bodies."</font> </td>

<p align="left"> <font color="white" size="+1">Herbert G. Wells <i>The War
of the Worlds </i>(serialized: 1897; book: 1898) </font>

<i>The Wars of the Worlds</i> is the story of the invasion of Earth by
technologically-advanced Martians. The Martians flee their dying
planet and descend in ten immense rocket capsules in southern
England. Their plan, to take over the Earth and its resources, begins
with an attack on London. People flee in panic, helpless against the
superior weaponry of the Martians which includes a ``Heat Ray'' and
poisonous Black Smoke. Victory seems secure when suddenly the Martians
succumb to a fatal infection by terrestrial germs.<br><br>

The 1890s were unhappy times for Wells as a struggling writer but
fortunate ones for his literature. <i>The Wars of the Worlds</i> is a
classic of English literature and much unlike the tawdry,
sensationalist sci-fi writing and films that have imitated and
recapitulated Wells' ideas. In the novel, a Wells-like writer on
philosophy and science narrates the story.  The book reflects a period
when a transition was occurring in Wells' thinking from the entirely
pessimistic world view of his earlier <i>The Time Machine</i> (1895)
to a more optimistic vision for future mankind evident in Wells' later
writing. Historically, <i>The Wars of the Worlds</i> followed a series
of semi-documentary novels that predicted war in Europe following the
unification and militarization of Germany beginning with George
Chesney's <i>The Battle of Dorking</i> (1871). In addition, <i>The War
of the Worlds</i> is very much a product of ideas that were at the
forefront of Wells' nineteenth century mind. These include Darwinism,
i.e. cumulative selection in biological systems, and a growing
awareness of the unpleasant side-effects of technology such as
industrial slums, instruments of war, and irresponsible power. The
monstrous Martians, the narrator tells us, have mutated with the help
of technology from their once humanoid form to a disgusting,
vampire-like state --- they are a possible future for
mankind. Apparent progress has somehow led to decline. Indeed, this
idea is inherent in the vulnerability of the Martians:
"Micro-organisms...have either never appeared on Mars or Martian
sanitary science eliminated them ages ago". So it is that biology
ultimately defeats the Martians: "These germs of disease have taken
toll of humanity since the beginning of things - taken toll of our
pre-human ancestors since life began here...By the toll of a billion
deaths man has bought his birthright of the earth, and it is his
against all-comers...For neither do men live nor die in vain". The
last sentence, which ordinarily would be a cliche of Victorian
sentimentality, is a Darwinist insight in this context.  The moral,
perhaps, to Wells' story is that technology will not defeat us or turn
us into the nightmare Martians as long as we hold fast to our diverse
biological heritage --- a moral which is just as relevant to our
environmentally-threatened world today as it was to Victorian England.
<br><br>

<font color="cyan"><b>Famous opening paragraph:</b></font> (<i>note how the ubiquitous
micro-organisms which prove crucial later in the plot are
mentioned here at the very beginning of the novel</i>)<br> <font color="white">
"No one would have
believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world
was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than
man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves
about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied,
perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise
the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water.
With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about
their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over
matter.  It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the
same.  No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources
of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life
upon them as impossible or improbable.  It is curious to recall some
of the mental habits of those departed days.  At most terrestrial men
fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to
themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise.  Yet across
the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of
the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic,
regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew
their plans against us.  And early in the twentieth century came the
great disillusionment." </font> </td> </tr></tbody></table></center>

</p><center> <table border="0" cellpadding="10" width="510"> <tbody><tr><td halign="center" valign="top"> Perhaps better known as the creator of "Tarzan of the Apes",
Edgar Rice Burroughs also wrote westerns and science fiction - a total
of 97 stories. Burroughs' series of Mars novels, also known as the
Martian Tales, comprises eleven novels which describe the adventures
of a nineteenth century Confederate Civil War veteran (like Burroughs'
father) named John Carter who is transported to Mars where he must
adapt to its strange cultures. Carter, as a classic fictional hero,
frequently encounters life-threatening situations which he only
narrowly escapes.  Carter marries, has children, rises to the top of
Martian politics, and there fights for justice. His noble actions reflect
Burroughs' personal moral beliefs.  Burroughs, like many other
writers, envisions a dying Mars with oceans that are drying up and
constantly warring kingdoms fighting desperately against the peril of
a vanishing atmosphere and against each other.  <br><br>

<font color="white">Note on the origin of </font><font color="#0cfb0c">"little green men"</font>: This phrase is frequently
used in modern English to refer to Martians or aliens. But where
does it come from? In Edgar Rice Burroughs first book about Mars, <i>A
Princess on Mars</i>, he describes the "green men of Mars" who reappear
frequently in his other Martian novels. This is probably related to the
origin of "little green men" although he never uses that exact
phrase. The <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030604153609/http://www.oed.com/">Oxford English
Dictionary</a>'s first reference for "little green man" is actually from
Kipling's 'Puck of Pook's Hill' (dated 1906). Its use here refers to an
actual person who has been tattooed green, and so although it actually
uses the phrase "little green man", it appears to be more descriptive
than a reference to aliens. The next OED reference to "little green men"
is not until 1961 from Partridge's Dictionary of Slang: "<b>Little green
men</b>, mysterious beings alleged to have been seen emerging from
flying saucers." But when was this term in this sense first used? If you
know, contact the OED.

</p><center> <table border="0" cellpadding="10" width="510"> <tbody><tr><td halign="center" valign="top">

Ray Bradbury's thought-provoking science fiction written in highly
literate prose arguably makes him one of the world's best science
fiction authors. <i>The Martian Chronicles</i> (1951, also
published as The Silver Locusts) is a collection of loosely-tied short
stories which together comprise the story of man's conquest of
Mars. Many of the chapters in <i>The Martian Chronicles</i> were
published separately, sometimes with minor changes, sometimes with
different titles; these include There Will Come Soft Rains, The Fire
Balloons, and others.  In early science fiction, Martians are the most
common culprits for invasions of Earth - a trend which followed <i>The
War of the Worlds</i> by H.G. Wells. In Bradbury's <i>The Martian
Chronicles</i>, we see how it can happen the other way around: humans
are the alien invaders on Mars. As in H. G. Wells' seminal novel, the
Martians are killed by terrestrial bacteria. But this time the
Martians are a beautiful, wise and ancient civilization. The book
raises important questions about human behavior, and how people should
react when they encounter alien races. It is a study of man's
selfishness, in particular, the destruction of culture by ignorant
politicians and businessmen.<br><br>

<font color="white">"...The Men of Earth came to Mars. They came because they were afraid
or unafraid, because they were happy or unhappy, because they felt
like Pilgrims or did not feel like Pilgrims. There was a reason for
each man. They were leaving bad wives or bad towns; they were coming
to find something or leave something or get something, to dig up
something or bury something or leave something alone. They were coming
with small dreams or large dreams or none at all....it was not unusual
that the first men were few. The numbers grew steadily in proportion
to the census of Earth Men already on Mars. There was comfort in
numbers. But the first Lonely Ones had to stand by themselves..."</font>

Heinlein's <i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i> (1961).  This book tends
to be a favorite amongst sci-fi fans -- it won a Hugo award in
1962. Nevertheless, amongst general literature, it was the first book
by a devoted science-fiction writer to reach the <i>New York Times</i>
best-seller list.<br>

Valentine Michael Smith, born on Mars, is the sole survivor of the
first manned mission to the planet. Subsequently, he is raised and
educated by Martians. When Smith gets returned to Earth as a young
man, he has human instincts but an alien perspective and superhuman
psychic powers. The time is roughly the 1990s, as written from the
1960s, and terrestrial society is envisioned to be highly
commercialized and corrupt ("He's an honest politician.  He stays
bought.").  Smith progresses from a total ignorance of this
(essentially western) culture to an understanding of human psychology.
Eventually, his efforts to reconcile human and Martian sensibilities
give rise to a new "free love" religion through which people achieve
spiritual transformation. There is a tragic but unsurprising ending.

<i>Red Mars</i> (1993). <i>Green Mars</i> (1995). <i> Blue Mars</i>
(1997).<br> This trilogy is a thought-provoking story of terraforming
Mars that stretches more than three centuries into the future. What
distinguishes Kim Stanley Robinson's books from other science fiction is
the sheer array of socio-economic issues that is confronted:
post-corporate governance, environmental ethics, population growth,
human longevity, and natural capital issues. On the other hand, the
trilogy does suffer from the intransigent assumptions of a
'technological optimist' worldview. (Is terraforming Mars really
possible, I ask?). <i>Red Mars </i> describes the colonization efforts
of the first hundred settlers on Mars. Splits develop between colonists
favoring rapid terraforming to a 'Green Mars' and a minority of 'Reds'
who want to see Mars preserved. Issues of corporate control versus
democracy eventually culminate in an attempt by the Martians to gain
independence from Earth and its transnationals. The second book <i>Green
Mars</i> deals with the transition of Mars to an Earth-like world with a
breathable atmosphere in the late 21st century. Meanwhile Earth itself
is undergoing severe environmental catastrophes due to environmental
degradation by the cumulative effects of industrial pollution. <i>Blue
Mars </i> describes the resolution of conflicts in terrestrial and
Martian societies.<br><br>

Welles/ Howard Koch </a> On October 30th, 1938, Orson Welles became
internationally famous. Wide-spread panic in the U.S. was induced by his
broadcast of an adaptation by Howard Koch of H.G. Wells' <i>The War of
The Worlds</i>. In the play, performed by The Mercury Theater, Martians
landed at Grovers Mill, New Jersey, and a growing sense of impending
doom was gradually built up in the style of news bulletins and
on-the-spot reporting. Terror across the United States due to this early
radio show hinted at the growing power of electronic media to invade the
public consciousness and create an artificial reality that could disrupt
the real world of comparative calm. Orson Welles, of course, later went
on to direct highly acclaimed films including <i>Citizen Kane</i> and
<i>The Magnificent Ambersons</i>. Howard Koch was later on the writer
team for the movie <i>Casablanca</i>.

is based on a short story by sci-fi, cyberpunk author <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030604153609/http://www.clas.ufl.edu/CLAS/Departments/Rewired/pkd.html">
Philip K. Dick </a> entitled <font color="cyan"><i>We Can Remember It For
You Wholesale</i></font>, only twenty pages long, and set entirely in two small rooms in
New York City. The story is complex and alien - a painful, detailed
examination of a man recovering suppressed memories, and the reactions
of those involved in his "therapy". Dick himself was in therapy at the
time of writing the story.  Philip K. Dick's novel <font color="cyan"><i>Do androids
dream of electric sheep?</i></font> also inspired the film
<font color="cyan"><i>Bladerunner</i></font>.<br>

<img src="mars-in-popular-culture_files/q_mark3.gif"> <i>Total Recall</i> ends when atmospheric gases
and water are liberated from sub-surface rocks of Mars. Curious about
whether this possibly has any scientific basis? See <font color="cyan">"Is
there liquid water on Mars?"</font> from our Mars' <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030604153609/http://humbabe.arc.nasa.gov/mgcm/faq/faq.html"><i>Frequently Asked

(1989)</a> <img src="mars-in-popular-culture_files/lobster_man2.jpg" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="4">
A comedy. A young film student tries to sell his weird movie to a
desparate film producer who is looking for a tax write-off. The
producer screens the film "Lobster Man From Mars".  A `film
within-a-film' sendup follows: Mars suffers from the loss of its
atmosphere, and the Martians send the evil Lobster Man to Earth to
steal its air. A mad scientist, a girl, and an army colonel foil the
alien plot. The producer buys the movie, but it makes a huge profit
and he is sent to jail. The film student then takes his place as the
studio hot shot.<br><br>


<font color="cyan"><i>Invaders from Mars (1986)</i></font> Directed by
Tobe Hopper. Starring Karen Black, Hunter Carson, Timothy Bottoms.  In
this remake of the classic 50s film, a boy tries to stop an invasion of
his town by aliens who take over the the minds of his parents, his
least-liked schoolteacher, and other townspeople.  With the aid of the
school nurse the boy enlists the help of the U.S. army.

</p><p align="left"> <font size="-1"> T.S. Eliot once described the science fiction genre as
a "product of the pre-adolescent mind". This is an unfair comment
for genuine works of literary quality (e.g. by Wells and Bradbury), but
probably wholly deserved for some of the movies that follow.</font>

</p><center>
<table border="0" cellpadding="10" width="510">
<tbody><tr><td halign="center" valign="top">

<font color="cyan"><i>Planet of Blood (1966)</i></font> Basil Rathbone
(the actor usually associated with Sherlock Holmes), John Saxon, Dennis
Hopper, Florence Marly. An expedition to Mars finds a crashed alien
space ship. They bring back the only survivor; a green skinned, glowing
eyed, bloodsucking, female alien who preys on the crew members.<br><br>

<font color="cyan"><i>Mars Needs Women (1966) </i></font>
The title says it all. Tommy Kirk leads his fellow Martians on an
interplanetary quest for females. Yvonne 'Batgirl' Craig is a scientist chosen by
the invaders. <br><br>

<font color="cyan"><i>Santa Claus Conquers The Martians (1964)</i></font>
John Call, Pia Zadora, Jamie Farr.  Santa is captured by Martians to
stop Earth kids from being cheery.  But once on Mars, Santa teaches
those little Martian brats the real meaning of Christmas. Quite possibly
the silliest movie ever made. The most excruciating and cringe-inducing
moment is at the end when the Martians, who are a bunch of kids
attired in green stockings, sing "Hooray for Santy [<i>sic</i>]
Claus"<br><br>

<font color="cyan"><i> Robinson Crusoe on Mars (1964) </i></font> Paul
("Apollo 13") Mantee, Victor Lundin, and Adam ("Batman") West. Directed
by Byron Haskins, who also directed <i>War of the Worlds</i>. This movie
follows Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe plot, but without the fear-factor
of footprints from the original story. Cmdr Christopher Draper (Mantee)
must survive on the barren planet accompanied only by his pet monkey,
Mona. Draper discovers minor plant life in the "canals" of Mars and
bakes Martian rocks to release oxygen in an otherwise oxygen-poor
atmosphere. Eventually a Man Friday appears and the trio ends up being
chased by flying saucers to one of the polar icecaps. Some uncharitable
people have said that the best acting in the movie is by Mona, the pet
monkey. Many scenes were shot at Zabriskie Point, Death Valley.<br><br>

<img src="mars-in-popular-culture_files/angryred_poster.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="6"><font color="cyan"><i> The Angry Red Planet (1959)</i></font> Gerald Mohr, Nora
Hayden, Les Tremayne.  A group of astronauts land on Mars. They then
have to put up with continual battles against aliens, a giant amoeba,
and the dreaded Rat-Bat-Spider thing (see picture).  Colored lenses give
a sickly pink hue to all the Mars sequences. <br><br>

<font color="cyan"><i> Devil Girl from Mars (1954)</i></font> Not the kind
of girl you really want to get involved with: pouty, leather-clad alien
bitch Patricia Laffa journeys to Earth in a giant spaceship (accompanied
by the obligatory killer robot) to bring back men for breeding
purposes. Very camp. Also with Hazel Court, Hugh McDermott and Adrienne
Corri.<br><br><br><br>

<img src="mars-in-popular-culture_files/WAR-WRL.jpg" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="6"><font color="cyan"><i> The War of the Worlds (1953) </i></font> Directed by
Byron Haskin, starring Gene Barry as Clayton Forrester. A film
adaptation of H.G. Well's classic novel best understood if you bear in
mind that it was made at the height of the Cold War - i.e. replace
Martian with Russian. The residents of a small town are excited when a
flaming meteor lands in the hills. Their joy is somewhat dampened when
they discover it has passengers who are not very friendly. Won an
Academy Award for special effects.<br><br>


<font color="cyan"><i>Invaders from Mars (1953)</i></font> Little David
MacLean has a problem--all the adults in town begin acting strangely
shortly after he sees strange lights settling behind a hill near his
home. As more and more adults are affected, he must turn to the pretty
Dr. Blake for protection. Eventually, he must confront his fears in the
unusual conclusion. Remade in 1986.<br><br>


<font color="cyan"><i> Abbott and Costello Go to Mars (1953)</i></font>
Lester (Bud Abbott) and Orville (Lou Costello) accidentally launch a
rocket which is supposed to fly to Mars. Instead it goes to New Orleans
for Mardi Gras. They are then forced by bankrobber Mugsy and his pal
Harry to fly to Venus where they find a civilization made up entirely of
women, men having been banished.<br><br>

<font color="cyan"><i> Red Planet Mars (1952)</i></font> Peter Graves,
Andrea King, Morris Ankrum.  A lame, anti-communist movie made under the
influence of McCarthyism.  Communications from Mars establish that the
planet is almost a utopia ruled by a supreme authority. News of this
somehow topples Russia and sends the world on to a new higher plane of
existence.<br><br>

<font color="cyan"><i> Flight to Mars (1951)</i></font> (Color) Carmon
Mitchell, Arthur Franz, Morris Ankrum.  A team of scientists and a
newspaper reporter fly to Mars only to find that Martians look identical
to humans. Mars is running low on an important natural resource called
Corium (whatever that is), so the Martians plan to steal the Earthmen's
rocket and conquer Earth. Fortunately, a sympathetic Martian underground
helps the Earthmen foil the dastardly plan.<br><br>

<font color="cyan"><i> Rocketship X-M (1950)</i></font> Lloyd Bridges,
Hugh O'Brian &amp; Morris Ankrum.  Five astronauts set off to explore the
moon but due to a malfunction they end up on Mars (..so annoying when
that happens!). There they find evidence of an advanced civilization
that has mostly perished in an atomic holocaust. The few Martian
survivors now live like savage cavemen. After two of the astronauts are
killed, the remaining three attempt to return to Earth.<br><br>


<font color="cyan"><i> Flash Gordon: Mars Attacks the World (1938)
</i></font> (a.k.a. Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars, Deadly Ray from Mars) A
feature-length (badly edited) abridgement of the 15-episode serial Flash
Gordon's Trip to Mars. Flash Gordon (Buster Crabbe), his lady love Dale
Arden (Jean Rogers), and scientific genius Dr. Zarkov (Frank Shannon),
blast off for Mars, where a mysterious force is sucking the nitrogen
from the Earth's atmosphere. They hope to determine the source of this
power and destroy it. The villain behind the Earth-threatening scheme is
none other than "Ming the Merciless" (Charles Middleton), who also
foments a deadly feud between Prince Barin of the planet Mongo (Richard
Alexander) and the Clay People of Mars. Ming hopes that this battle will
allow him to conquer the universe in the confusion. But the Clay People
ultimately align with Barin and Flash Gordon, and Ming is
defeated. <br><br>

<font color="cyan"><i>Aelita: Queen of Mars (1924)</i></font> Director:
Jakov Protazanov.  A silent Soviet propaganda film : a comparison
between 1921's Russia, and a capitalistic planet Mars.  Engineer Los is
building a spaceship to reach Mars. He kills his wife, Natacha (a
refugee care worker), flees to Mars, and falls in love with Aelita, the
Queen of Mars. But it's all a dream, thank goodness.
