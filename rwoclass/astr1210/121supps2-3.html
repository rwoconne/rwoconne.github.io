<hr noshade>

There are three special supplements which are required reading for
this class.  <a href="121supp1.pdf"><b>Supplement I</b></a> (a PDF
file) contains reference material on units of measurement, powers of
ten, nomenclature, and special symbols.  It should be <b>consulted as
necessary</b> throughout the remainder of the course.</p>

<b>Supplements II and III</b> are intended
to <b>replace</b> the material in the textbook covering the basic
properties of matter, the nature of forces, the electromagnetic
spectrum, and how astronomers exploit the properties of the EM
spectrum to deduce the physical nature of distant objects.  They also
serve as the <a href="guideindex.html">Study Guides</a> for the
lectures where this material is covered.  Most of the concepts
presented in II and III should already be familiar to you.  These
supplements are available in this HTML file. </p>

</h1>

<p><br></p>

<h2>A.  Elementary Particles </h2>

You should already be familiar with three elementary particles:
the <b> electron</b>, the <b>proton</b>, and the <b>neutron</b>.
These are the primary constituents of <b>atoms</b>.  Atoms were first
proposed as the basic components of matter by Greek philosophers (e.g.
Democritus, ca. 400 BC), and their reality was debated for thousands
of years.  Their existence was proven beyond doubt in the 19th
century.</p>

Protons and neutrons are bound together in the <b>nucleus</b> of the atom, an
object about 10<sup>-13</sup> centimeters in diameter. The electrons
orbit the nucleus in a cloud which is 100,000 times larger,
10<sup>-8</sup> cm in diameter.  There is a multitude of other
elementary particles, most of which exist only for very short periods
of time; most of these will not be discussed further in the course.</p>

<center><img src="im/AtomLabeled.gif" border=2 width=25%></center></p>

Two properties of elementary particles are relevant for us: their 
<b>mass</b>  and   <b>charge</b>. </p>

Roughly speaking, <b>mass</b> is the "amount of matter" in an object.
Quantitatively, it is the <b> inertial mass</b> and measures the
"resistance" of an object to an applied force (as expressed in Newton's
Second Law). The larger the mass, the harder it is to move the object.
 Mass is measured in grams:</p>


<ul>

<li>Mass of proton (or neutron) = 1.7 x 10<sup>-24</sup> grams </p>

<li> Mass of electron = mass of proton/1800</p>

</ul>

<b>Charge</b> is a property of particles which determines their behavior 
when acted on by <b> electromagnetic forces</b> . "EM" forces are described 
in more detail in section B.</p>

<ul>

All elementary particles which have been isolated are found to have only 
certain definite amounts of charge: none, exactly one positive unit 
of charge, or exactly one negative unit.  (Protons and neutrons 
are constructed of even more basic subunits 
called "quarks", which have fractional charges. But these are strongly
bound together inside protons and neutrons.  Free quarks 
should rarely exist and have never been observed in the laboratory.)</p>

<ul>

<li> The neutron has zero charge </p>

<li>The proton has a charge of +1 </p>

<li>The electron has a charge of -1 </p>

(Note: The + or - sign is simply a convention
indicating that electrons and protons behave differently in EM force
fields.)    </p>

</ul></ul>

Since the nucleus of an atom contains only protons and neutrons, it will have
a positive charge. The basic property that distinguishes the various
<b>elements</b>  from one another is the <b>number of protons</b> in their
nuclei or, equivalently, the amount of positive charge on the nucleus.</p>

There are <b>92 naturally occurring elements</b> on the earth, ranging from
hydrogen (with only one proton in its nucleus and no neutrons) to
uranium (with 92 protons and 146 neutrons).  [Other elements, e.g.
plutonium, have been artificially produced, but all of these are
unstable and have finite lifetimes.]  <b>All materials</b>, despite
their myriad appearances, are made of these 92 types of atoms.  In
fact, most everyday materials, including living things, are made of no
more than <b>about 20 types</b> of atoms.  </p>

<ul>

Note: the abundances of elements on the Earth are very different from
their  <b>cosmic abundances</b>  (i.e. those in the stars or the
interstellar gas).  75% of the earth's crust is oxygen or
silicon. However, in our galaxy, hydrogen makes up about 72% of the
total mass, helium another 25%, and all other elements only 3%.</p>

</ul>

In their undisturbed or "neutral" state, atoms have as many electrons
as protons and therefore have a <b> net</b> charge of <b>zero</b>. Under many
circumstances, however, electrons can be stripped out of the cloud
which surrounds the nucleus. The atom is then said to
be <b>ionized</b> and is referred to as a "positive ion" since it has
a net positive charge.
</p>


The last elementary particle we will discuss is the <b>photon</b>,
which is not a "regular" particle at all.  It has zero mass
and zero charge. Instead, the <b>photon is a packet of electromagnetic
energy</b>.  The concept of the photon is a product of the <b>quantum
theory</b>, which describes the behavior of elementary particles. The
photon is the "particle" which transmits the electromagnetic force
between charged particles. Light waves consist of photons, as do radio
waves, and the discrete, particle-like impact of photons on special
detectors can actually be readily demonstrated in the
laboratory. Photons are discussed further in Supplement III.</p>


<a name="forces"> </a>
<h2> B.  Forces</h2>   </p>

If particles did not exert forces on each other, there would be no
organization in the universe: no planets, no stars, no people.
Particles would move throughout space in random but unchanging paths,
never altering their motion even when they passed through one
another.</p>

However, particles do exert forces on each other, and the
nature of these forces depends on the mass, charge (and other
"internal" properties we will not discuss), and state of motion of the
particle.</p>

Isaac <b>Newton</b> was the first to formulate a quantitative
description of <b>how</b> matter responds to forces which are
applied to it.  Historically, Newton's laws were a major stimulus
for both the scientific revolution and the industrial revolution since
they demonstrated that the universe is understandable through rational
analysis.  His description is encapsulated in his <b>second law of
motion</b> :</p>

<ul>

<b>F  =   m a </b> </p>

</ul>

where F is the force applied to an object, m is the 
object's inertial mass, and a is the object's 
acceleration.  </p>


Newton's formulation is now known <b>not to apply on microscopic
scales</b>, such as to sub-atomic particles.  On macroscopic
scales, however, it is an excellent approximation and is the basis,
for example, of structural, mechanical, and aeronautical engineering.</p>

Acceleration is the <b>rate of change of velocity</b>.  An object is
said to accelerate if <b>either its speed or
direction of motion</b> changes.  It is the only one of the three
parameters in the second law (force, mass and acceleration) which can
be readily observed. So, it is useful to solve the equation for
acceleration:</p>

<ul>
<b> a  =   F  /  m .</b></p>
</ul>

<ul>

This expression implies that for a given mass, the larger the force
the larger the acceleration.  Also, for a given force, the larger the
mass the smaller the acceleration.  A boxcar is more massive than your
little brother and is therefore harder to push around.</p>

As the rate of
change of a quantity (velocity), acceleration is the mathematical
<b>derivative</b> of velocity (which is itself the derivative of
position).  Also, the force may depend on position, velocity, and
other properties of the system.  Thus, this expression is actually
not a simple algebraic expression but instead is a <b>differential
equation</b>.  In order to solve it, Newton was forced to develop
<b>calculus</b>, one of the most powerful and valuable intellectual
tools ever invented.  </p>

</ul>

Newton recognized only two kinds of force: (i) gravity, and (ii) the
force produced by physical contact (e.g. you pull on something, a
spring pushes something, the wind shifts something, etc.). We now
realize that all varieties of this "physical contact" force are
manifestations of <b>electromagnetic force</b>.  But this was not
understood until over 150 years after Newton published his Second Law.
Fortunately, it was not necessary to know how objects <b>produced</b>
the forces they exerted on one another in order to predict how they
would <b>move</b> in response to those forces.  </p>

There are <b> three</b> categories of forces exerted by particles on
each other that are now recognized: gravity, nuclear forces, and
electromagnetic forces.  Forces can be characterized by their <b>
strength</b>, their <b>range</b>, and their <b>coupling</b>
(that is, which properties of particles determine the response to a
particular force).  </p>

<h3> Gravity</h3>  

The gravitational force is an <b>attractive</b> force between any two
objects containing <b>mass</b>. All particles in the universe attract
each other; any pair of particles which start from rest will
eventually move together (in the absence of other nearby particles).
Gravity seems strong and inexorable in everyday life, but in fact it
is by far the <b>weakest</b> of the known forces.  Gravity falls off
with distance, but is a <b>long-range</b> force compared to the
nuclear forces (e.g. it can act over intergalactic distances).</p>

<ul>

Newton was the first to develop a quantitative theory of gravity.  In
Newton's formulation, gravitational force acts along the line
connecting the two objects and is <b>proportional to the
product of the masses</b> of the two objects but <b>inversely proportional to
the distance between the two squared</b>.  That is,</p>

<ul>

<b>

F<sub>grav</sub>  = G    M<sub>1</sub> x M<sub>2</sub> / R<sup>2</sup>
</p>

</b>
</ul>

where G is a numerical constant, M<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>2</sub> are
the masses of the two objects, and R is the distance between the two.</p>

Newton showed that, when combined with his second law, this force law
correctly predicted the observed motions and orbits of the planets.
In particular, the predictions were in <b>complete agreement
with Kepler's Laws</b> of planetary motion, which had been derived
from the extensive observations of <b>Tycho</b>.  See <a href="guide08.html">
Study Guide 8</a> for more details.</p>

</ul>
Newton's theory was shown to be inadequate by Albert <b>Einstein</b>
(1916) in the presence of large masses or over large distances, and
has been replaced by the General Theory of Relativity in such
situations.  Relativity theory profoundly changed our understanding of
space and time.  But as a practical matter, Newton's theory is an
entirely satisfactory description of "everyday" gravity.  Only very
minor corrections to the Newtonian predictions are necessary, for
example, to send spacecraft with high accuracy throughout the solar
system.  </p>

<h3>Nuclear Force</h3> 

This is a <b>short range</b> force, acting
over distances of only 10<sup>-13</sup> cm (i.e. about the size of an
atomic nucleus). It has no direct influence over significantly larger
distances.  (The longer range effects of nuclear materials, e.g. in
radiation therapy, are produced by particles or photons ejected from
atomic nuclei by the nuclear forces, not the forces themselves.)
Because this is the case, the effects of nuclear force are described
by the <b>quantum theory</b> and not Newton's Second Law. Technically,
nuclear force is subdivided into the <b>strong</b> and
<b>weak</b> forces (and hence you will often find references to the
<b>"four forces"</b> of nature, rather than the three described here).</p>

<ul>

Inside the nucleus, nuclear forces are <b>very strong</b>, some
10<sup>40</sup> times stronger than gravity(!), which is wholly
negligible in nuclei. The nuclear forces bind protons and neutrons
together in nuclei. They are responsible for nuclear power,
radioactivity, and the explosive energy of nuclear bombs.</p>

[Note that "atomic bomb" is really a misnomer, since it is not atoms
that release the energy in a fission or fusion bomb but only their
nuclei.  <b>Chemical</b> explosives (e.g. dynamite) are the real
"atomic bombs" because their energy release originates from changes in
the electron shells around the nuclei.]
</p>

</ul>

<h3>Electromagnetic Force</h3> 

The ubiquity of the effects of
electromagnetic (EM) force make it the <b>most important in
everyday life</b>. It is, of course, responsible for electricity
and magnetism.  But it is also the source of combustion, solidity,
friction, capillary action, etc. In short, it holds our everyday world
together.  EM force is responsible for all <b>chemical reactions</b>,
including those occurring in biological organisms.</p>
<ul>

The simplest form of EM force is the <b> electrostatic force</b> ,
which acts between any two objects with <b>net charge</b> which are at
rest.  If the two charges have the same sign (both + or both -), the
force is repulsive and the objects tend to move apart. If the two
charges are opposite, the force is attractive (like gravity).  The ES
force is a <b>strong force</b>: the ES repulsion between two electrons
is 10<sup>36</sup> times stronger than the corresponding gravitational
attraction.  It is also in principle a <b>long range</b> force--but
not in practice, since macroscopic objects tend to have zero net
charge.</p>


The <b>magnetic force</b> is more complicated. It acts in a complex
manner on <b>moving</b> charged particles.  Two objects with zero net
charge can interact magnetically if charges inside of them move in
sufficiently organized patterns ("currents"). A bar magnet is an
example of an object with zero net charge which can be affected by
external magnetic fields.  The Sun, the Earth, and most other planets
also have fairly strong magnetic fields, which affect the motion of
particles near them.  On the Earth's surface the most familiar
magnetic effect is found in the orientation of a compass needle to the
Earth's "magnetic poles".  Magnetic forces are also <b>long
range</b> but are much more important on galactic scales than are
electrostatic forces because they are usually not self-shielding like
ES forces. On such scales they are usually less important than
gravity, however.</p>

Notes:</p>

<ul>

We have never been able to identify any special interaction (e.g. a
"life force") that is harbored only by living beings and governs their
functioning, behavior, or mental processes.  EM forces control all biological
phenomena, including
<a href="http://www.consciousentities.com/crick.htm">consciousness</a>. </p>

EM force is the only kind of interaction which could be fashioned into
the mysterious "force fields" favored by science fiction writers or
could be responsible for claimed borderline phenomena like
telekinesis, extra-sensory channels of communcation, etc.</p>

</ul>
</ul>


<b>Atoms</b> contain a nucleus with positive charges 
and a surrounding electron cloud of negative charges.  It is
the <b>EM forces between these charged particles that hold atoms
together</b>.  Michael <b>Faraday's</b> (ca. 1830) investigations of the
electrical properties of materials provided the first clues to this
fundamental discovery, and incidentally made it possible to utilize
electrical power as the basic tool of modern civilization (see
<a href="guide09.html" >Study Guide 9</a>).  Nuclear
forces do not play a major role on the scales corresponding to the
sizes of atoms; they are important only inside the nucleus.  </p>

<ul>

When two atoms approach each other, their constituents feel a
combination of attractive and repulsive forces, depending on the exact
configuration of the nuclei and electrons.  Under the right
circumstances, atoms can <b>bond</b> together---i.e. the attractive
force overcomes the repulsive force---and create a stable system.
This is called a <b>molecule</b>.  Most molecules are relatively
simple, consisting of only a few atoms (water consists of only three),
but organic molecules can be of enormous size, containing thousands to
millions of individual atoms.</p>

<b>Chemical energy</b> is released when the electronic configuration
of molecules is altered through interactions between them.
<b>Fire</b> is perhaps the most obvious everyday example of chemical
energy release.  </p>

<!-- This is true "atomic energy."  -->

<!-- What people mean by "atomic
energy" is really "nuclear energy" instead. -->

<center><small><em>Atoms in a crystal</em></small></center></p>

<b>Solids</b>
are formed when atoms and molecules are in a sufficiently dense
material that their electron clouds interpenetrate and form a bond
strong enough to keep their nuclei in an approximately rigid
configuration.  In some solids, electrons are held tightly to their
nuclei.  In others, electrons are free to move in response to external
electromagnetic fields; these materials are called <b>conductors</b> of
electricity.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2>A.  Electromagnetic Waves </h2></p>

Based on the experimental studies of Faraday and others, especially
Faraday's discovery of electromagnetic induction and his concept of a
magnetic force field, James Clerk <b>Maxwell</b> managed to summarize
(ca. 1865) all electromagnetic phenomena in a set of elegant and
interconnected equations now known as <b>Maxwell's equations</b>.
These represent the <b>third great generalized physical law</b>, the
first two being Newton's equations of motion and his theory of
gravity.</p>

Maxwell was able to show that his equations implied that <b>electric and
magnetic force fields can <a
href="http://www.phy.ntnu.edu.tw/java/emWave/emWave.html" >
propagate through space</a></b>. 
A moving electron, for example,
sends out a disturbance which can cause other electrons to move;
"target" electrons at successively greater distances will feel the
disturbance at successively later times. The propagating disturbance
is similar to a water wave produced by a rock dropped into a pond and
is therefore called an <b> electromagnetic wave.</b> </p>

One of Maxwell's great discoveries was that he could use his equations
to <b>predict the velocity of an EM wave</b> as it propagated through
a vacuum. He found the velocity to be the same as the <b> speed of
light</b>, which had already been determined with fair precision.  The
immediate inference was that
<b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light">light is one kind of
electromagnetic wave.</a></b></p>

Maxwell's theoretical prediction of EM waves was later
confirmed experimentally by Heinrich <b>Hertz</b> (1887), who detected, for
the first time, artificially generated <b>radio waves</b>.  Only a few years
later in 1895, the physicist Wilhelm <b>R&ouml;ntgen</b> discovered high energy
EM waves in the form of <b>X-rays</b> and simultaneously recognized their
tremendous penetrating power and usefulness as medical diagnostics.  Maxwell's
prediction of EM waves has had profound practical consequences.  </p>

<a name="EMspec">

<center><img src="im/wave-nomenclature-CM.jpg" border=2 vspace=10 width=50%></center>
<center><small><em>Wave disturbances</em></small></center></p>


EM waves are classified by their <b>wavelength</b> or <b>
frequency</b>.  By analogy to water waves, the wavelength of an EM
wave is the distance between crests (or places where the EM effects are
strongest).  See the figure above.  The frequency is the number of
crests passing the observer per second. If the waves move with a
definite velocity, then it is easy to see that wavelength and
frequency must be inversely related to each other.  The longer the
wavelength, the lower the frequency; and the shorter the wavelength,
the higher the frequency.  Wavelength is measured in whatever unit of
length is most convenient:  from centimeters or millimeters at long
wavelengths to &Aring;ngstroms (where 1 &Aring; = 10<sup>-8</sup> cm)
for optical light.  Frequency is measured in cycles ("crests") per
second or Hertz (1 Hz = 1 cps).</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2>B. The Electromagnetic Spectrum</h2>


All frequencies from zero to infinity are possible for EM waves, and
this total range is called the <b>electromagnetic spectrum</b>.  See
the figure below; the textbook presents other illustrations and more
information.  <b> Radio, television, microwaves, infrared, visible
light, ultraviolet light, X-rays, and gamma rays are all forms of EM
waves.</b> All of these waves travel at the <b>same speed</b> (at
least in a vacuum): the speed of light, which is 300,000 kilometers
per second (186,000 miles per second). </p>

<center><img src="im/em-op-spectrum.gif" border=2 vspace=10 width=50%></center>

<center><em>Full EM spectrum with visible spectrum enlarged<br> (Units marked
are microns.  1 micron = 10,000 &Aring;)</em></center></p>

The <b>human eye is directly sensitive only to a very small  range of
wavelengths</b> in the EM spectrum. This is called the  <b>"visible"</b> or
<b>"optical"</b>  region. It extends roughly from wavelengths of 4000
&Aring; in the deep violet to 7000 &Aring; in the deep red. Green light has
a wavelength around 5000 &Aring;, or about 0.0005 mm.</p>

The wavelengths or visible light are far smaller than
sizes encountered in everyday life.  Therefore,
we are not conscious of light's wavelike character.
However, radio waves are long enough that wave effects such as
<b>diffraction</b> are obvious: the fact that radio waves can reach
you even if the transmitter is hidden behind a building is a result of
the waves diffracting around the building, just as water waves can
move around a rock near the beach. (For more on diffraction, see
<a href="guide14.html">Study Guide 14</a>.) </p>

<ul>
<a href="http://www.falstad.com/ripple" >
<img src="im/film.gif">Applet.</a> Here
is an interactive Java applet illustrating wave diffraction.
</p>

</ul>

Although our eyes are not sensitive to most EM wavelengths, sensors in
our skin can detect <b>infrared</b> EM waves (10,000-100,000 &Aring;), which
we perceive as <b>radiant heat</b>. Shorter wavelengths in the
<b>ultraviolet and X-ray</b> cannot be sensed directly by our bodies;
but these can cause damage to cells. For instance, damage resulting
from exposure to ultraviolet light appears as "sunburn".  
Fortunately,
most of this harmful cosmic X-ray and UV is screened out by the Earth's
atmosphere and does not reach sea level. </p>


In fact, the <b>Earth's atmosphere is opaque to most wavelengths</b>
in the EM spectrum.  The chart below shows the ability of different
wavelengths to penetrate the atmosphere.  The screening is protective
for lifeforms on Earth's surface.  But obviously, it is not convenient
for astronomers who want to monitor the universe across the full EM
spectrum.  (This is the main motivation for <b>
<a href="http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/rwoclass/astr511/UV-astron-f03.html">
space astronomy</a></b>.)
The atmosphere also absorbs large parts of the Earth's infrared
spectrum, which leads to the atmospheric heating phenomenon known as
the <b>"greenhouse effect"</b> (see <a href="guide15.html">Study
Guides 15</a> and <a href="guide19.html">19</a>.)</p>

Notes:  

<ul>

<b>Sound is not an EM wave</b>.  A sound wave is a
<b>compressional</b> disturbance in a <b>medium</b> (air, water, etc.) and
propagates far more slowly than EM waves.   Sound waves cannot
exist in a vacuum, whereas EM waves can.</p>

<ul> The difference in propagation speed between sound and light is
vividly apparent during a thunderstorm.  The light of a lightning
flash will reach you almost instantaneously, whereas the sound travels
at a speed of only 1100 feet per second, so there will be an
appreciable lapse between the flash and the sound of the corresponding
thunder.  To estimate the distance of the lightning flash (in feet),
simply multiply the number of seconds between the flash and the sound
arrival time by 1100. A 5-second delay means the lightning strike
was over a mile away.</p>

</ul>

Also, most <b>"atomic or nuclear radiation"</b> is not electromagnetic
either.  Instead, it consists largely of highly energetic subatomic
<b>particles</b>.  It is dangerous to living things because of its
potential to <b>ionize</b> biological molecules, including those in
genes.</p>

EM waves are also often referred to as <b>"EM radiation."</b>  But it
is important to distinguish long-wavelength EM waves (e.g. 
from a computer terminal or microwave oven), which are
almost never dangerous in everyday situations, from more threatening
kinds of "radiation."  </p>

</ul>

<p><br></p>

<h2>C. Photons</h2>

Although EM radiation does have many wavelike properties, it is
<b>not</b> simply a wavelike disturbance.    It is absorbed or
emitted from particles in tiny packets, called  <b>photons</b> , which
themselves behave more like particles than waves. The energy of a
photon depends on its frequency (in the wave analogy): the higher the
frequency, the larger the photon's energy. </p>

Photons are created or destroyed by atoms through interactions
with the charged particles within the atom.  According to the
quantum theory, the internal energy states of an atom are  <b>
discrete  or quantized</b>.  This means that the electron cloud
around the nucleus of the atom can exist only in certain definite
energy states.  Whenever the cloud changes its energy state, a certain
definite amount of energy must be lost (if the energy drops) or gained
(if the energy increases).  One of the most important ways in which
atoms lose or gain energy is through photons.  The electron cloud can
<b>spontaneously lose energy by  emitting a photon</b>,
which then escapes from the atom.  Alternatively, it can  <b>absorb</b> 
a photon which is near the atom, thereby gaining energy (and
destroying the photon).  </p>

<h2>D.  Spectroscopy </h2></p>

As a consequence of sponteneous photon creation by atoms, <b>all
objects which are above a temperature of absolute zero emit
electromagnetic waves</b>---even textbooks and ice cubes.  There is a
great deal of information about the physical properties of the object
contained in the distribution of wave energy as a function of
wavelength or frequency in its electromagnetic spectrum.  For short,
this distribution is called the object's <b> spectrum</b>.
<b>"Spectroscopy"</b> is the study of EM spectra.</p>

The spectrum of a <b>dense</b> object like the Earth or Lake
Superior or the inner regions of the Sun is <b>smooth or
"continuous"</b> and changes only slowly with wavelength.  You can
think of the atoms and electrons in such an object as interacting so
strongly that the individual signatures of each type of atom are
blended away.  Such an object is said to be in <b>thermal
equilibrium</b>, and the resulting spectrum is sensitive <b>only to
its temperature</b>. This kind of spectrum is called a <b>blackbody
spectrum</b>, named after ideal, laboratory sources which are purely
self-luminous and reflect no light.  Such sources have a spectrum with
a smooth, well-defined, characteristic shape, as shown in the figure
below:  </p>

<center><small><em> This diagram shows how temperature affects the
distribution of the emitted blackbody spectrum of a dense object.<br>
(The wavelength scale is in nanometers.  500 nm on this scale
corresponds to 5000 &Aring; or 0.5 microns.)  The colored bands show
the "visible" part of the EM spectrum.</em></small></center></p>

As shown here, <b>hotter</b> objects emit more energy at
<b>shorter</b> wavelengths while cooler objects emit more energy at
longer wavelengths.  Hence, <b>hot stars will look blue-white to the eye
while cool stars look orange-red</b>. The spectrum of the Sun, with a
surface temperature of almost 6000<sup>o</sup> Kelvin peaks at about 5000
&Aring; --- i.e. in <b>yellow-green light</b>.  </p>

<ul>

Does this fact, combined with the principle of natural biological
selection, suggest a reason why our eyes are most sensitive to
yellow-green light? </p>

An incandescent light bulb operates by using an electric current to
heat a thin metal filament until it glows brightly, at about
2500<sup>o</sup> Kelvin.  Higher temperatures would vaporize the
filament.  Hence, incandescent light bulbs are redder than the Sun
and, in fact, redder than any of the stars visible to the unaided eye,
which all have temperatures above 3000<sup>o</sup> Kelvin.  </p>

</ul>

<!-- Earth temp values from Wikipedia, May 10.  5/28/10: long time,
inexplicable error in peak output wavelength for Earth corrected; tens
of thousands of people have read this page, but no one has ever
pointed out the error to me!  Believe this was written hurriedly
in 1998 and never reality-checked! -->

On the other hand, the Earth, with an overall mean surface temperature
of only 287<sup>o</sup> Kelvin (14<sup>o</sup> C), peaks at a
wavelength of about 100,000 &Aring; (10 microns) in
the <b>infrared</b> part of the spectrum.  Since our eyes are not
sensitive at this wavelength, the Earth looks "dark".</p>

<ul> Objects at room temperature (about 300<sup>o</sup> Kelvin) also
emit their peak radiation in the infrared.  They
are <b>self-luminous</b> at those wavelengths, but the light we can
detect from them with our eyes is <b>not their own self-radiation</b>
but rather
<b>reflected light</b> from higher temperature sources (such as the
Sun or incandescent light bulbs).</p>

For instance, see the image below, which compares the visible-band
(reflected light) with the "thermal-infrared" appearance of a cat
(with a body temperature of about 312 Kelvin). </p>

<p>The <b>total</b> radiative output from a blackbody source (summed over
all wavelengths) is a very strong function of its temperature and
scales as the temperature (on the Kelvin scale) to the fourth power
(T<sup>4</sup>). </p>

So far, we have discussed dense systems.  By contrast, in a dilute or
<b>thin</b> gas---the outer atmosphere of the Sun or an interstellar
gas cloud, for example---the atoms do not interact strongly, and if
there is a large enough number of atoms of a given type (e.g. hydrogen
or oxygen), they will impress their
<b>individual signatures</b> on the emergent spectrum.  </p>

<ul>

If you could pump up a single atom to a high energy state and then
observe it sitting quietly without further outside disturbance, you
would find that it would emit a series of photons with <b>discrete</b>, but
different, energies as it lost energy from its electron cloud.  Thus,
its spectrum would consist of a series of sharp peaks: only certain
frequencies or wavelengths would be included.  It would be faint (or
dark) except at the peaks.  This is called an   <b> "emission line
spectrum"</b>  because if you plotted the number of emitted photons versus
their frequencies, it would resemble a picket fence. </p>

If you imagine the same atom left in a low energy state but placed
in front of a dense, glowing object, you would observe a spectrum which
was the reverse of the atom's emission line spectrum.  Here, you
would see light from the background glowing object at all frequencies
<b>except</b>  where the object's photons could be absorbed by the electron
cloud.  This is an   <b>"absorption line spectrum"</b>: dark at those
discrete frequencies where the
electron cloud can absorb energy but bright elsewhere.  
The 3 general kinds of spectra are summarized in the illustration
below:  </p>

</ul>

<center><img src="im/frak-emspec-types-ex.jpg" alt="EmSp Types" border=2 vspace=10
width=72%>
</center><br>

The essential practical implication of these facts stems from the fact
that <b> the spectrum of each type of atom is different because its
electronic structure is different</b>.  A hydrogen atom has a
different spectrum than a helium atom, and carbon atoms have a yet
different spectrum.  Obviously, then, the emission or absorption line
spectrum of a star or planet is related to its <b>chemical
composition</b>.</p>

<ul>

It is, in fact, through analysis of such spectra that we know the
chemical content of stars, the interstellar gas, and other galaxies
<b>even though they are tremendously far away</b>. </p>

For instance, the figure below shows part of the spectrum of the Sun
at yellow wavelengths.  The dark lines are produced by atoms of
magnesium, iron, titanium, and other elements in the cooler, outer
layers of the Sun which are seen against the bright continuum produced
by its hot inner regions.  Quantitative analysis of such spectra tells
us the detailed chemical makeup of the Sun.  For example, the
element <b>helium</b> (the second lightest after hydrogen) was
discovered in the spectrum of the Sun <b>before</b> it was studied in
an Earth-bound laboratory.  Click on the image for an enlarged
spectrum of the Sun.</p>

<h2>E.  Luminosity and Flux </h2></p>

The <b>luminosity</b> of an object is defined to be the <b>total
amount of electromagnetic energy radiated by the object in a given
time</b>.  It may refer to the whole EM spectrum, in which case it is
denoted a "bolometric" luminosity, or it may refer only to a limited
part of the spectrum.  For example, the "visual" luminosity of a star
refers to the total energy output in the visible part of the
spectrum.  It is denoted L<sub>V</sub>.</p>


Luminosity is an <b>intrinsic</b> property of the object; that is, it
does not depend on how far away the observer is. "Intrinsic
brightness" or "power" are synonyms for luminosity. In the cgs system,
luminosity is measured in <b>ergs per second</b>. </p>

The response produced by an object of given luminosity in a detector
(for example the human eye) depends both on the luminosity and the
 <b>distance</b> of the object. More distant objects produce smaller
responses. The response of a detector to a given source of EM
radiation is a function of the <b>flux</b> of radiation from the
object. The flux is defined to be <b>the energy crossing a given area
in a given time</b>.  It is measured in ergs per second per square cm
(ergs/sec cm<sup>2</sup>) in the cgs system.  Flux is <b>not an
intrinsic property</b> of the source because it depends on the observer's
distance. The greater the flux, the greater the response of a given
instrument. Flux can be defined with respect to part or all of the EM
spectrum.</p>

A little thought will lead you to realize that flux = (total energy
output of source per unit time)/(area of sphere passing through observer with center
on source). Or, </p>

<ul>

<b> F =   L / (4 x pi x R<sup>2</sup>)</b></p>

</ul>

where F is the flux from the source, L is its luminosity, and R is its
distance from the observer.  Like the expression for Newtonian
gravitational force, this is an "inverse square law".</p>

 
<p><br></p>

<h2>F.  The Doppler Effect </h2></p>


The  <b>Doppler Effect</b>  is a <b>change in the apparent wavelength or
frequency of an EM wave caused by the motion of the source</b> of the wave
toward or away from the observer.  It also occurs with sound waves,
where it is most familiar as the change in pitch of a police or
ambulance siren as it passes you on the street.  When the siren is
approaching you, the pitch is higher (i.e. the frequency is higher and
the wavelength is shorter) than when it is receding from you (lower
frequency, longer wavelength).</p>

The Effect is explained by the fact that if a source is approaching you
while emitting a wave of fixed wavelength, each successive crest of
the wave starts from a position a bit closer to you than the preceding
one.  But the crests still travel at the same velocity.  This means
that the distance between successive crests (the wavelength) traveling
in your direction will be smaller than if the source were stationary.
The stream of crests moving in your direction is therefore more
<b>"compressed"</b> than for a source at rest.  You will observe a signal
with shorter wavelength (higher frequency) than that from the same
source at rest.  Conversely, if the source moves away from you, the
stream of crests is <b>"stretched"</b>, and you will observe a longer
wavelength (lower frequency).  "Doppler radar" makes use of this
phenomenon to measure the motion of air streams in the atmosphere or
of automobiles on the highway (often in the hands of the state 
police).  </p>

<ul><ul>

<a href="http://lectureonline.cl.msu.edu/~mmp/applist/doppler/d.htm"> 
<img src="im/film.gif">Here</a>
is a nice Java applet illustrating the Doppler Effect.  You can
interactively adjust the velocity and direction of motion of the
source.  Note how the propagating waves are compressed along
the direction of motion but expanded along the opposite direction.
The magnitude of the effect depends on the velocity of the source.
If the source moves faster than the speed of propagation in
the surrounding medium, a cone-like "shock wave" results; this is what
produces a "sonic boom" from a supersonic jet plane in the atmosphere.
However, since no source can move faster than the speed of light in a
vacuum, this case doesn't apply to light waves emitted by objects
moving in space.</p>

</ul></ul>

Applied to astronomical spectra, the Doppler Effect is particularly
valuable, since it allows us to measure the <b>motion of distant
objects toward us or away from us</b> --- i.e. what astronomers call the
<b>"radial velocity."</b>  By measuring the exact wavelengths of spectral
emission or absorption lines and comparing them to the expected values
for atoms which are at rest, we can estimate the motion of objects
along our line of sight (i.e. radially).  The method does not depend
on the distance of the object.  Since the change in wavelength is
toward the blue end of the spectrum if the object is approaching and
toward the red end if it is receding, astronomers speak of <b>"blue
shifts" and "red shifts."</b>  The <b>cosmic red shift</b>, observed
in the spectra of distant galaxies, is the principal evidence that the
<b>universe is expanding</b>.</p>

The animation below shows how the Doppler Effect can be used to detect
the motion of objects in orbit around one another.  This is the
technique used to discover the existence of 
<a href="guide11.html"><b>exoplanets</b></a> in orbit around other
stars.  Hundreds of exoplanetary systems have been discovered with
this method to date.  </p>
