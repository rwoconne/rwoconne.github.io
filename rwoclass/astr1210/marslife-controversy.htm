"NEW HINT OF LIFE IN SPACE IS FOUND: Meteorites Yield Fossilized,
One-Cell Organisms Unlike Any Known on the Earth," shouted a
headline in "The New York Times." "Something Out There," chimed
in"Newsweek." Respected scientists told crowds of reporters that
their work, published in a prestigious journal, revealed complex
hydrocarbons and what looked like fossilized bacteria buried deep
within a meteorite. This, they claimed, provided "the first
physical evidence for the existence of forms of life beyond our
planet."<P>
That was 1961. And the meteorite in question was not the
<A HREF="http://www-sn.jsc.nasa.gov/planetscience/marsmet/text.htm">one
from Mars</A> that has made recent headlines but another that had
fallen a century earlier in Orgueil, France. Under closer
scrutiny, the astonishing evidence was eventually thrown out of
the court of scientific opinion. The organic chemicals and
"fossils" turned out to be ragweed pollen and furnace ash. <P>
So it is with understandable skepticism that scientists are
greeting the bold assertions, made by
<A HREF="http://ilewg.jsc.nasa.gov/register/dmckay/bio.htm">David S.
McKay</A> of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
Johnson Space Center and eight colleagues, that the peculiar
features they found in meteorite
<A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/snc/alh.html">ALH84001</A> are best
explained by the existence of primitive life on early Mars.
Despite public enthusiam about the conclusions, published in
<A
HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/273/5277/924.html"><I>Science</I></A>,
many leading researchers who study meteorites and ancient life
have weighed the evidence and found it unconvincing. "There are
nonbiological interpretations of McKay's data that are much more
likely," says
<A HREF="http://www.uark.edu/depts/cheminfo/uarkchem/dsears.html">Derek
Sears</A>, editor of the journal
<A HREF="http://www.uark.edu/meteor/"><I>Meteoritics and Planetary
Science.</I></A><P>
On August 7 the nightly news recounted ALH84001Us impressive
resume: born 4.5 billion years ago in Mars's depths; splashed by
a huge impact into interplanetary space to drift for 16 million
years; captured in Earth's gravity and dragged into Antarctic
snow; buried in ice for 10 to 20 millennia until 1984, when
meteorite hunters, trudging seven abreast across the Allan Hills
ice flow, picked it up and made it famous. That much nearly
everyone agrees on; the controversy centers on the rock's less
glamorous inside story.<P>
McKay and his collaborators build the case for life on four lines
of evidence. The first are
<A HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/full/273/5277/924/F2.htm">orangish
blobs</A>, no bigger than periods, that dot the walls of the cracks
and crevices perforating the meteorite's shiny crust. These
multilayered formations, called carbonate rosettes, tend to have
cores rich in manganese, surrounded by alternating iron- and
magnesium-enhanced layers and a rind consisting primarily of
magnetite. Bacteria in ponds can produce similar rosettes as they
metabolize minerals. But "that is a perfectly reasonable sequence
to find in a changing chemical environment as well," counters
Kenneth Nealson, a biologist at the
<A HREF="http://www.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin</A>, who was one
of the paper's peer reviewers.<P>
The second line of evidence centers on the discovery of organic
compounds called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, in
and around the carbonate.
<A HREF="http://www-chem.stanford.edu/faculty/zare/">Richard N. Zare</A>, a
Stanford University chemist and co-author of the <I>Science</I>
paper, reports that the rock contains an unusual mixture of
certain lightweight PAHs. "In conjunction with all the other
data, it seems most likely to me that they all came from the
breakdown products of something that was once alive," he says.<P>
Critics suggest other possible explanations, however.
"Hydrothermal synthesis could take inorganic carbon and water and
make aromatic organics; you would get the same ones they report,"
points out Bernd Simoneit, a chemist at
<A HREF="http://www.orst.edu/">Oregon State University</A>. "And look at the
Murchison meteorite, thought to come from the asteroid belt,"
adds <A HREF="http://epsc.wustl.edu/people/shock.html">Everett Shock</A> of
Washington University. "Hundreds of organic compounds have been
identified in it, including amino acids and compounds closer to
the things organisms actually use. It has carbonate minerals in
it, too--and real solid evidence of water--yet there isn't
anybody saying that there is life in the asteroid belt."<P>
Training high-power electron microscopes on ALH84001, McKayUs
group found its third and most cogent bit of evidence: tiny,
teardrop-shaped crystals of magnetite and iron sulfide are
embedded in places where the carbonate is dissolved, presumably
by some sort of acid. The authors note that certain bacteria
manufacture broadly similar magnetite and iron sulfide crystals.
<A HREF="http://www.gps.caltech.edu/faculty/kirschvink/kirschvink.html">Joseph
Kirschvink</A>, a biomineralogist at the California Institute of
Technology, agrees that the mineral formations are intriguing.
"If it is not biology, I am at a loss to explain what the hell is
going on," he says. "I don't know of anything else that can make
crystals like that." Shock remains unconvinced. "There are other
ways to get those shapes. And in any case," he continues, "shape
is one of the worst things you can use in geology to define
things."<P>

</TABLE>
The final thread of evidence is the one that has drawn the
sharpest attacks from skeptics. Examining bits of ALH84001 under
an electron microscope, McKay's team found provocative, elongated
and egg-shaped structures within the carbonate; the researchers
interpreted these as likely fossilized microorganisms. Many
scientists are still unconvinced that such organisms ever existed
on Earth, let alone anywhere else. There is also a real danger of
an observer effect at work.<P>
"The problem," says NASA exobiologist Jack Farmer, "is that at
that scale of just tens of nanometers, minerals can grow into
shapes that are virtually impossible to distinguish from
nanofossils." Nealson moans that "I'd get drummed out of the
microbiological society if I showed pictures like that and
claimed I had bacteria." But Everett Gibson of the NASA Johnson
Space Center, another of McKay's co-authors, responds that "we
eliminated that possibility for most of our examples by noting
the lack of crystal growth faces" and other mineralogical
features. McKay adds that he looked at a different meteorite as a
control and saw no similar formations.<P>
Some critics also find the small size of the "fossils" hard to
square with the other evidence. "These structures contain one
one-thousandth the volume of the smallest terrestrial bacteria,"
points out <A HREF="http://www.life.uiuc.edu/Micro/woese.html">Carl R.
Woese</A> of the University of Illinois, who studies the biochemistry
of ancient life. "They really press the lower limit," he says, of
how tiny a living unit can be. (But
<A HREF="http://checfs1.ucsd.edu/~nscort/Research/Miller/miller_re/cgi-bin/search.cgi">Stanley
Miller</A> of the University of California at San Diego, himself a
doubter, asks, "Who knows how much space you really need?")
Moreover, the putative Martian bacteria are hardly larger than
the mineral crystals they are supposed to have produced.
"Magnetic bacteria are mobile; they swim," Kirschvink adds.
"That's why magnetic orientation is selective--it aids
navigation. But these nannobacteria are too small to contain
enough magnetite to make them align properly to the magnetic
field."<P>
If not life, then what can account for this odd collection of
features? One possibility is a hydrothermal process. "Imagine hot
fluids flowing through the crust," suggests John F. Kerridge, a
planetary scientist at the University of California in San Diego.
"The crystallization of magnetite, iron sulfides and carbonate
with a change in the chemistry over time is perfectly reasonable.
If anywhere in the subsurface of Mars there are PAHs, then they
would be carried by this fluid and deposited where the fluids
crystallize. I think the nanostructures are most likely an
unusual surface texture resulting from the way in which the
carbonate crystallized."<P>
Then there is the specter of contamination during the meteorite's
long residence in the Antarctic.
<A HREF="http://checfs1.ucsd.edu/~nscort/Research/Bada/bada_re/cgi-bin/search.cgi">Jeffrey
Bada</A> of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla,
Calif., notes that PAHs have been found in glacial ice, albeit at
very low concentrations; when he analyzed a different Martian
meteorite, he found that terrestrial amino acids had worked their
way into the rock. McKay and his colleagues tried to avoid being
fooled by contaminants by running the same tests on several
Antarctic meteorites. They showed, among other things, that
nothing was living inside ALH84001 at the time it was analyzed,
that most (but not all) of the carbonates harbored isotopes
associated with Mars and that PAHs were more concentrated inside
the rock than on its surface. "These arguments are flaky and
simplistic," Sears rebuts. "Weathering is a sloppy process.
Things leach in, then leach out; they do not do the obvious. The
chemistry of the water can change."<P>
A number of scientists also fret that the attention given to the
McKay paper could ultimately prove counterproductive. "I'm really
somewhat taken aback by the hullabaloo," Bada says. "If it turns
out to be wrong, a lot of people are going to be very
disappointed. And it will take an ongoing effort for a decade or
more before we sort it out."<P>
That endeavor is already under way. Researchers in many
disciplines are scrambling to obtain pieces of ALH84001 and the
11 other meteorites identified as being of Martian origin in
order to run further tests. Zare says he wants to search for
amino acids and to compare the carbon 13 in the PAHs with that of
Mars--work that some feel he should have done before going public
with his results. McKay has talked about obtaining electron
micrographs of thin sections of the nanofossils to look for cell
walls and internal structure, but such efforts will push the
limits of present technology.<P>
Nealson and others insist that the only way to prove beyond doubt
that something once lived on Mars is to send a robotic probe to
Mars to deliver rocks back to Earth--another daunting technical
challenge. NASA plans to launch two probes later this year, but
the agency did not envision a sample-return mission until 2005,
although NASA administrator
<A HREF="http://www.npr.gov/NPR_AnnualRep/Bios/goldin.html">Daniel S.
Goldin</A> recently spoke of accelerating the schedule. Also, a
committee chaired by
<A HREF="http://ilewg.jsc.nasa.gov/register/greeley/bio.htm">Ronald
Greeley</A> of Arizona State University has warned that tight budgets
are slowing the development of the rovers and drilling equipment
needed to search for Martian fossils or subsurface life.<P>
Beneath all these thoughts lies a nagging question: Will we even
know life if we see it? Some unconventional thinkers such as
<A HREF="http://www.library.wisc.edu/libraries/College/circreserve/ereserves/biocore/deephot/deephot.htm">Thomas
Gold</A> of Cornell University and English astronomer
<A HREF="http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~eww/bios/Hoyle.html">Fred Hoyle</A>
have suggested that life may exist in unlikely environments, such
as cometary nuclei or the crust of the moon. Even identifying
carbon-based life is ferociously difficult--what if some life
follows unconventional chemistries? "It boggles the mind to think
of these questions," reflects Miller. "You have to stick with
what you know; the alternative is sitting around, looking at your
navel."<P>
If the results reported by McKay's group hold up, Miller suspects
it will be just the tip of the iceberg. "My impression is that
bacterial life exists on planets around one in 10 stars, maybe
more," he speculates. "I would view life on Mars not as a
surprise but as a new frontier."<P>
