<h2>A. Earth as a Planet:  Uniqueness </p></h2>

<ul>

<li> <b>Largest</b> terrestrial planet</p>

<!-- <a href="im/earthmo2.gif"><img src="im/earthmo2-smex.gif"
align="right"></a>
  Leave this image in Moon lecture. -->

<li> Has <b>largest satellite</b> with respect to its own diameter (see images
in <a href="guide13.html">Guide 13</a>)
</p>

<li> Large atmospheric abundance of <b>water</b> is unique among
terrestrials</p>

<li> <b>Open oceans</b>: unique in the solar system; water covers 2/3 of
Earth's surface and produces its signature blue color</p>

<li> <b>Oxygen-rich</b> atmosphere (21% by volume)</p>

<li> <b>Life!</b> Living organisms cover the Earth.</p>

<ul>
There is no definite evidence yet for any other biospheres in the
solar system.  If these exist, the lifeforms are likely to be
primitive.  See <a href="guide23.html">Guide 23</a>.
</p> </ul>

</ul>

<p><br></p>

<h2>B. The Earth's Biosphere</h2> 

<ul>

<li>  Consists of Earth's crust, oceans, lower atmosphere:</p>

<img src="im/spinning-earth-anim.gif" align="right" width=20% hspace=10 vspace=10>

<ul>

<li> <b>Thin!</b>.  A total thickness of about 25 km (15 miles),
compared to Earth's 8000 mile diameter.  For a sense of the thinness
of the atmosphere, see <a href="im/ISS-against-limb-1.jpg">this
picture.</a> </p>

<li> For a scale model:  Take a piece of paper.  Fold once.  Paste on
a basketball.  A thin smear of lifeforms on a huge sphere.</p>


</ul>

<li> <b>Fragile!</b></p>

<ul>

<li> We live in a delicate balance with nature</p>

<li> In cosmic time, our favorable ecosystem is <b>transient and
evolving rapidly</b>.</p>

<ul>

<li> For example: Earth's surface, as hard and unchanging as it may
seem, is <b>only temporary</b>.</p>

</ul>

<li> Although the rapidly growing human population (see Study
Guides <a href="guide09.html">9</a> and <a href="guide19.html">19</a>)
is having deleterious effects on the biosphere, these are survivable
(even if the costs could be enormous).  The most serious, long-term
threats to the ecosystem are <b>extraterrestrial</b> and beyond
immediate human control: asteroid/comet impacts, solar evolution,
supernovae and other stellar explosions, etc.</p>

<li> Astronomy is the <b>ultimate ecology</b>.</p>

</ul>
</ul>

<h2>C. The Age of the Earth</h2>

Our experience of everyday time is of little help in visualizing the
age of the Earth.  Hundreds or thousands of years represent the
longest time scales we can easily comprehend, yet the age of the Earth
is <b>millions of times longer</b>.

<a href="im/earth-geological-clock-lrg.jpg"><img src="im/earth-geological-clock-lrg-sm.jpg"
width="25%" align="right" hspace=12 vspace=12></a>

The model time scale described
in <a href="guide01.html">Study Guide 1</a>, based on the pages in our
textbook, is probably the best way of attempting to retrain your
thinking about cosmic time.</p>

<ul> Another useful illustration is in the form of the face of a
"cosmic clock."  An example is shown at the right.  At this scale, you
can't even see the current era of human dominance.  Click for a
full-sized version.</p>


Throughout the vast majority of its history, the Earth's atmosphere,
surface features, and especially its lifeforms, were dramatically
different from what we experience today.</ul>

There are two primary methods for dating the Earth's surface: </p>

<ul>

 <li> <b>Sedimentation rate/geological strata</b> method</p> 

<ul>

  <li> Developed in the 19th century (after road and railroad
      construction exposed deep rock layers)</p>

  <li> The rock layers of the Grand Canyon, for example, were once
  under water.  They are <b>hardened sediment</b> that settled to the
  floors of ancient seas, deposited over long periods of time by
  rivers that flowed into the oceans.  The sedimentary layers can
  contain <a href="im/geolog-strata-crosscut-ca-1910.jpg">fossils</a>
  of ancient plants and animals. They can also harbor processed
  organic material in the form of <b>oil and natural
  gas</b>.  </p>

  <li> Age-dating based on <b><em>stratigraphy</em></b> makes use of
  the relatively uniform rate of sediment deposition to estimate the
  age of different stata.  Deeper layers are older, and thicker layers
  were exposed to deposition for a longer period of time.  For an
  example of dating of the Grand Canyon, click on the picture below.
  "Bio-stratigraphy" uses embedded fossils to refine ages.  </p>

  <li> These methods are <b>not very precise</b>, but they were
  sufficient to prove to 19th century geologists that the Earth's
  surface had evolved over at least <b>millions of years</b> of time.
  This recognition has been called <b>"the discovery of Deep Time."</b></p>

  <li> Stratigraphy is still very important in determining the <b>relative
  ages</b> for different rock formations, which can be traced across
  huge geographical
  areas.  <a href="im/marcellus-shale-base-EastUS.jpg">Here</a> is a
  pertinent example, showing the distribution of the recently
  exploited gas-rich Marcellus shale formation across the eastern
  US.</p>

</center>

<ul>

<a name="radiodating">
  <li> <b>Radioisotope (or "radiometric") dating</b> method</p>

<ul>

 <li> This is based on the well-determined <b>decay rates</b> of the
  nuclei of naturally occurring <b>radioactive ("unstable")
  isotopes</b>, e.g.
  <a href="im/U238-decay-chain-TSmith.jpg" > uranium ==>
  lead</a>.  It is <b>much more precise</b> than stratigraphy, and the basic
  mechanism is thoroughly understood on the basis of <b>quantum
  mechanics</b>.  It can be applied to rock samples obtained anywhere on
  the Earth or elsewhere in the solar system (e.g. from the Moon or
  meteorites).</p>
</ul>

<ul>

 <li> The "half life" of an unstable isotope is the time it takes for
half of the original sample to decay to a "daughter" isotope.  See <a
href="http://lectureonline.cl.msu.edu/~mmp/applist/decay/decay.htm"
>this Java Applet</a> illustrating the decay process.  Half
lives for unstable isotopes are determined by the structure of their
nuclei and range from microseconds to billions of years. </p>

<li> Method: first, chemically separate parent from daughter isotopes;
then estimate the age from the ratio of parent to daughter.</p>

<ul>
"Carbon-14" dating is the best known type of radiometric dating.
Because the half-life of <sup>14</sup>C is only 5570 years, it is
very important for studies of historical and pre-historical human
artifacts;  but it is not useful for geological time scales.</p> 

For time scales up to billions of years, dating schemes using
decay chains such as <a href="im/U238-decay-chain-TSmith.jpg" >uranium-lead</a>
or rubidium-strontium are used.  These can yield 
a dating precision in the range of 0.1-2%.  </p>

</ul>
</ul>

<li> Result:  The age of the Earth is about 4.5 billion years, based on
the dating of many different kinds of samples.</p>

<ul>

   <li> The oldest Earth surface rocks:   3.9 billion years (a few samples of
     zircon crystal date to 4.4 Byr)</p>

   <li> <a href="guide13.html">Moon rocks & soil,</a> meteorites:
   4.5-4.6 billion years</p>

<ul>
The oldest Earth surface rocks are <b>younger</b> than those of the
Moon, even though the Earth probably formed somewhat earlier than the
Moon, because the Earth's surface has been <b>recycled by plate
tectonics</b>.</p>

<h2>D. Earth's  Interior</h2>

<ul>

  <li> Earth's mass can be determined from the orbit of the Moon or of
artificial spacecraft by applying <a href="guide08.html">Kepler's 3rd
law</a>.</p>

<ul>

<li> Reminder: the Earth's mass can <b>not</b> be determined from its
orbit around the Sun (see <a href="guide08.html" >Study
Guide 8</a>).</p>

</ul>

  <li> The <b><em>density</em></b> of a planet, defined to be its mass
divided by its volume, is an essential clue to its composition.
Despite is much smaller diameter, Earth has a <b>higher</b> density
than does Jupiter:</p>

<ul>

  <li> Earth  5.5 grams/cc ==> heavier elements (like Si,O,Fe)</p>

  <li> Jupiter 1.3 grams/cc ==> lighter elements (H,He)</p>

</ul>

<a href="im/seismicwaves-UTenn.gif" ><img
src="im/seismicwaves-UTenn.gif" width=25% hspace=12 vspace=12 align=right></a>


<li> We are able to probe the interior
using <a href="im/seismic-waves-crossec-CM.jpg" ><b><em>seismic
waves</em></b></a> from earthquakes</p>

<ul>

  <li> These show that the interior is <b><em>differentiated</em></b>: i.e. 
the composition and density <b>change</b> with depth</p>

  <li> 3 main zones:  Core (innermost), mantle (body), crust (outermost).<br>
       (See illustration above.)  </p>

  <li> Densities range from 12 grams/cc in the core to 3 grams/cc in
       the crust, implying that the <b>core contains more heavy elements</b>
       than the crust.  </p>

  <li> Temperature at the core is over 5000 K. </p>

</ul>

<li> The differentiation implies that Earth's interior was once
<b>molten</b>, so that heavier materials could <a
href="im/differentiation-TSmith-uwash.jpg" > settle to the
center</a>.</p>

<ul>

<li> Initial heat source:  <b>impacts</b> of infalling planetesimals during
formation stages.  Further heat was released during differentiation, as heavier
materials sank.  </p>

<li> A persistent (lasting billions of years) interior heat source:
<b>radioactive decay</b> of uranium and other materials.  Even though
they constitute only a small fraction of the Earth's makeup, the heat
generated by decay of these materials escapes only slowly, so the
interior remains molten/plastic.  </p>

</ul>

<li> Heat transfer/cooling</p>

<ul>
<li> Interior heat escapes from planets through their surfaces.  Heat
is transferred by several processes: </p>

<ul>

  <b><em>Conduction</em></b>:  transfer of energy by contact at the molecular level 
      from hotter to cooler regions.</p>

  <b><em>Convection</em></b>: transfer of energy by actual
      rising/falling motions of material. These "convection currents"
      systematically deposit interior heat at shallower depths.  </p>

</ul>

<li> As long as the interior retains significant heat, its transfer to
the surface drives various forms of <b>"geological activity"</b> (see next
section).  Convection currents are also responsible for producing a
<a href="im/earth-magfield.jpg"><b>magnetic field</b></a> extending into space.  </p>

</ul>
</ul>

<h2>E.  "Plate Tectonics"</h2>


<ul>

  <li> A new (1950's - 60's) "paradigm" for the origin of geological
       structures.  Click <a
       href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/geology/techist.html" >
       here</a> for the history of plate tectonic interpretations.</p> 

  <li> The outer layers of the Earth (the crust and the upper mantle,
       together called the <em>lithosphere</em>) are <b>thin and cracked</b>
       into pieces called <b>"plates"</b> (diagram above).  These float on
       the partially melted, plastic material (the
       <em>asthenosphere</em>) below them.</p>

  <li> The plates <b>move</b> in response to the
       slow <a href="im/mantle-convection-3FD8.jpg">convection
       currents</a> in the mantle.
       </p>

<ul>

  Convection circulation includes rising warm material and falling cool material.
       It is driven by the temperature gradient within the Earth.</p>

 Typical motions are <b>very small</b>, about 1 cm per year.  This
       sounds ridiculously tiny, but such motions can now be easily
       measured with technologies similar to those of the GPS system.
       </p>

 On geological time scales such motions have drastic cumulative effects, as
 plates collide with each other or are exchanged with the mantle. Over
 100 million years (a short time geologically), a motion of 1 cm per
 year adds up to 1000 km.  </p>

</ul>

  <li> <a href="im/plate-motions-illus.jpg" >Plate motion
   or <b>"continental drift"</b></a> is responsible for all the major 
   <b>geological activity</b> on the Earth's surface: mountain building,
   rifting, earthquakes, vulcanism (as at right), etc.</p>

  <li> Earthquakes and vulcanism are concentrated primarily at
   the <b>periphery of plates</b> where two plates are moving against
   each other (e.g. the "Pacific Ring of Fire", see
   the <a href="im/earth-plates.gif" >map above</a>).  Young mountain
   ranges (e.g. the Andes and Himalayas) are also found at the 
   edges of plates.</p>

 <li> The Earth's surface is being <b>continuously recycled</b>.
   Older plates are pushed back into the interior and melted 
   while newer materials are added to the surface in upwelling zones.
   Melting of plates gassifies some of their materials and cycles
   those back into the atmosphere.
  </p>

   <li> Earth is the <b>only terrestrial planet</b> with continuous,
    large-scale tectonics</p>

    Hawaiian volcanoes are produced by
    a <a href="im/hawaiian-hot_spot.gif" >concentrated plume of hot
    magma</a> rising from the interior rather than by plate
    collisions.  This is the same kind of mechanism that produced
    the <a href="marsImages.html#plume" >Tharsis volcanoes</a> on
    Mars.]</p>

<p><small>Earth's Atmosphere From Orbit</small></center> 

<h2>F. Atmosphere</h2>

<ul>

<li> The original atmosphere was <a href="im/mayon-vol.jpg"
>"outgassed"</a> from the interior soon after Earth formed.</p>

<li> There has been <b>strong evolution</b> of the constituents of the
atmosphere over time</p>

<ul>

Many different physical processes drive atmospheric evolution for the
terrestrial planets.  A pictorial summary is
given <a href="im/atmospheric-evol-processes-3FB18.jpg"> here</a>.</p>

These and their consequences for Earth, Venus, and Mars will be
discussed further in <a href="guide19.html">Study Guide 19.</a> </p>

</ul>

<li> Earth's atmosphere is now predominantly N<sub>2</sub>, and
O<sub>2</sub>.  This is <b>unlike</b> the atmospheres of Venus and
Mars (which are mainly CO<sub>2</sub>) and unlike the early Earth
atmosphere.</p>

<li> O<sub>2</sub> is directly linked the the presence of <b>life</b> on Earth.
It is produced mainly by photosynthesis in plants and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxygenation_Event">
started rapidly increasing</a> in the atmosphere about 500 million
years ago.  Since it is so reactive, <b>free O<sub>2</sub> cannot
persist in an atmosphere without life</b>.
</p>

<li> The temperature at any height is determined by the balance of heating
against cooling.</p>


<li> Circulation (wind) is driven by heating (near equator)
vs. cooling (near poles) and by effects of Earth's rotation (the "coriolis
effect")</p>

</ul>
