Mars features the most interesting surface of any planet other than
Earth.  Even though Mars is a smaller planet, its land area is about
the same as Earth's (since two-thirds of Earth's surface is covered by
oceans).  Mars' terrain is an exaggerated version of the Earth's.  The
spacecraft campaign of orbiters and landers which began in the
mid-1990's has yielded an enormous amount of information on Mars. </p>

You can find a large number of beautiful Mars images taken by
terrestrial telescopes and spacecraft on the Web.  Some of the better
sites are linked to the <a
href="guide16.html">
Study Guide 16</a> page on Mars.  </p>

Here, I've selected images which illustrate the variety of terrain on Mars
and the extent to which we are now able to study it from spacecraft.  </p>

<center><h2>MOLA Maps of Mars</h2></center>

Topographic maps produced by the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA)
on the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) mission (1998-2006).  Left:  Tharsis
hemisphere. Right: Hellas hemisphere.  Color coding is for altitude
(blue is lowest, red high, white is highest---but doesn't indicate
snow). Click on the images for larger versions.  For a high-resolution
enlargement, click <a href="im/global-altim-all-lrg.jpg"
>here</a>.</p>

Identifications for the various Martian features visible here are
given <a href="im/MOLA-w-IDs-seeds.jpg" >here (main areas)</a>,
 <a href="im/marsmap-IDs-MOLAteam-2.jpg" >here (details)</a>, or in a
large-format poster <a href="
http://rwoconne.uvacreate.virginia.edu/mars-topo-poster-MOLA-lrg.pdf">here</a>.</p>

The Tharsis hemisphere is dominated by the <a
href="marsImages.html#plume">"Tharsis Bulge"</a> a huge, elevated surface
deformation which produced striking volcanoes and canyons.  The Hellas
hemisphere consists mainly of cratered highlands, punctuated by a
single enormous impact basin (<a
href="marsImages.html#hellas">Hellas</a>).  The cratering density shows
that the Tharsis hemisphere is significantly younger, on average, than
the Hellas hemisphere.  Tharsis is probably 2-3 billion years old.</p>

An even more remarkable asymmetry revealed by the MOLA altitude maps is
the large 5 km (16,500 ft) difference between the mean elevations of
the (low) northern hemisphere and the (high) southern hemisphere.  The
north is less heavily cratered (meaning younger) and smoother.  It is
dominated by a huge, flat depression (blue in the images above), which
may be the bed of an ancient <a
href="marsImages.html#oceans">ocean</a>.  </p>

MOLA map of the dramatic Tharsis (left) and Chryse (right) regions on Mars,
color-coded for altitude as above.  Click on the map for a high-resolution
image of the area.</p>

Clearly marked are the major Tharsis volcanoes: Olympus Mons (the
isolated peak to the west at coordinates 18N, 228E), Alba Patera (40N,
250E) and the volcanic chain consisting of Ascraeus, Pavonis and Arsia
montes.  In the lower center of the map is the gigantic Valles
Marineris canyon system (stretching from 265E to 310E).  At the right
side are the Chryse channels, running toward the northern plains.  The
large red (high altitude) blotch corresponds to
the <a href="marsImages.html#plume">"Tharsis Bulge."</a> </p>

Although the Tharsis Bulge itself is thought to be over 3 billion
years old, volcanic activity in the form of smooth lava flows
continued in some areas there until as recently as 100 million years
ago.  There is even improving evidence that some small flows occurred
in the last few million years.  Mars may not be quite as dormant
a planet as had been assumed.  </p>

<center><h2>Volcano Olympus Mons</h2></center></a>

Olympus Mons, located west of the Tharsis bulge, is the largest volcano
known in the Solar System, with an altitude of 88,000 feet 
(<a href="im/OlympMons-v-Everest-TSmith-uwash.jpg" >compare to
Mt. Everest</a> at 29,000 ft above sea level and 43,000 ft above the ocean
floor), a diameter of 340 miles, a <a href="#OMcaldera">caldera</a> 44
miles in diameter and flanking cliffs reaching 20,000 feet in
altitude.  If situated in Virginia, it would occupy most of the land
area of the state.  It is a shield volcano, like the large volcanos in
Hawaii.  These tend to have relatively quiescent eruptions of fluid
lava, without the explosiveness associated with ash eruptions or more
viscous lava (as in Mt. St.  Helens).  The massive concentration of
magma which built up Olympus Mons and the Tharsis bulge apparently
originated in an enormous <a href="#plume">mantle plume.</a> </p>

This is a composite of Viking images, projected in perspective as if
seen from an altitude of about 30 miles at a distance of about 1500
miles.  </p>

    This view of Apollinaris Patera, shows characteristics
of an explosive origin and an effusive origin. Incised valleys in most
of the flanks of Apollinaris Patera indicate ash deposits and an
explosive origin. On the west side (bottom), landslides that have shaped
its surface also indicate ash deposits. Towards the south flank, a
large fan of material flowed out of the volcano. This indicates an
effusive origin. Perhaps during its early development Apollinaris
Patera had an explosive origin with effusive eruptions taking place
later on. [Image & caption by Calvin J. Hamilton.] </p>

Caldera of Elysium Mons photographed by Mars Global Surveyor with its
narrow angle, high resolution camera (July 1998).  Elysium Mons is the
only large Martian volcano that is not part of the Tharsis complex. It is
41,000 feet high and has a large, round caldera with steep
cliffs on one side.  Several channels carved by lava flows are
present, but there is no evidence of erosion by rainfall.  Some of the
craters are of impact origin, but most are probably produced by
volcanic activity.  About 1/3 of the full MGS image is shown here.

<center><h2>Tharsis Plume Computer Simulation</h2></center>

     This image shows a computer simulation of processes
in the interior of Mars that could have produced the Tharsis region.
The color differences are variations in temperature. Hot regions are
red and cold regions are blue and green, with the difference between
the hot and cold regions being as much as 1000 C (1800 F).  Because of
thermal expansion, hot rock has a lower density than cold rock.  These
differences in density cause the hot material to rise toward the
surface and the cold material to sink into the interior, creating a
large-scale circulation known as mantle convection.  This type of
mantle flow produces plate tectonics on Earth.</p>

The hot, rising material tends to push the surface of the planet up,
and the cold, sinking material tends to pull the surface down. These
motions contribute to the overall topography of the planet. This
deformation of the planet's surface is shown in gray along the outer
surface of the planet in this image. The amount of deformation is
highly exaggerated to make it visible here. The actual uplift in
Tharsis is estimated to be about 8 kilometers (5 miles) at its center.
This uplift also stretches the crust, forming features such as grabens
and <a href="#valles">Valles Marineris.</a> In addition, the hot,
rising material may melt as it approaches the surface, producing <a
href="#olymp">volcanic activity.</a> [Simulation & caption by Walter
S. Kiefer and Amanda Kubala, LPI.] </p>

<center><h2>Valles Marineris</h2></center>

This great rift canyon on Mars, seen here in a Viking mosaic image, has a
length of 2400 miles (it would reach from Washington, DC to Los
Angeles), a maximum width of 70 miles, and a maximum depth of 22,000
feet.  It is vastly
<a href="im/ValMar-v-GrCan-TSmith-uwash-enl.jpg" >larger than
the US "Grand" Canyon</a>, which would barely qualify as a "side channel"
here.  Valles Marineris was not produced by water flow (although many
smaller Martian channels were).  Instead, it appears to have formed by
a stretching and tearing of the Martian crust during the <a
href="#plume">Tharsis plume</a> upwelling event.

<center><h2>Views of Mars' Northern Polar Cap</h2></center>

The frame at the left shows Mars' northern polar cap shrinking from
its maximum size in winter to its minimum in summer (images taken from
near-Earth orbit by the Hubble Space Telescope).  In winter the cap
is predominantly frozen carbon-dioxide ("dry ice"), whereas the persistent
summer cap consists of water ice.  The spiral patterns that emerge in
summer are enlarged in the MGS image at the right, which has been digitally
rendered by R. Kosinski.  The patterns are shaped by strong windflows.
The long, dark indentation is Chasma Boreale, a 300-km long canyon
reaching almost through the polar cap.  </p>

sedimentary deposits at the bottom of a lake.  This is strong
circumstantial evidence for water on Mars at an earlier time.  If
these are sediments, they might contain fossils of ancient Martian
lifeforms.  Similar features might be produced by lava flows or
windblown dust deposits, but their ubiquity on Mars suggests water is
involved.  Click for a full-scale version.  [Image by Malin Space

<center><h2>Water on Mars: Ravi Vallis</h2></center></h2>

A Viking mosaic of the Ravi Vallis channel.  Unlike <a href="#valles">
Valles Marineris</a>, this channel was carved by water.  The region shown
is about 225 mi long.  </p>

Like many other channels that empty into the northern plains of Mars,
Ravi Vallis originates in a region of collapsed and disrupted
("chaotic") terrain within the planet's older, cratered highlands.
Structures in these channels indicate that they were carved by liquid
water moving at high flow rates (up to 1000's of times the outflow of
the Amazon River). The abrupt beginning of the channel, with no
apparent tributaries, suggests that the water was released under great
pressure from beneath a confining layer of frozen ground. As this
water was released and flowed away, the overlying surface collapsed,
producing the disruption and subsidence shown here. Three such regions
of chaotic collapsed material are seen in this image, connected by a
channel whose floor was scoured by the flowing water. The flow in this
channel was from west to east (left to right). This channel ultimately
links up with a system of channels that flowed northward into Chryse
Basin.  [Image & caption: LPI]</p>

  <center><h2>Water on Mars: Frozen Lake in Crater</h2></center></h2>

This image of a crater in near the Martian North Pole was taken
by the High Resolution Stereo Camera on the Mars Express orbiter.
It shows a large lake of water ice.  The temperature when the image
was taken was above the sublimation temperature of carbon dioxide
("dry") ice, so the material must be water ice.  The lake is about
10 km (33,000 ft) across.  </p>

  <center><h2>Water on Mars: Hematite "Blueberries"</h2></center></h2>

The Mars Exploration Rover "Opportunity" took this close up of the
surface near its landing site showing thousands of tiny spherules
called "blueberries" because of their blueish tint in false-color 
images.  They contain hematite, an iron-oxide mineral precipitated
from water.  Such "concretions" are also found on Earth.

<center><h2>Water on Mars: Ancient Ocean Beds?</h2></center></h2>

This is a MOLA elevation map of the north polar hemisphere, with the
outline of the US added for scale. It shows a huge depression which
has many characteristics expected for an ancient ocean bed.  Its
border is level in elevation, like a coastline; terraces run parallel
to the coastline; its floor is smooth and relatively flat, suggesting
sedimentation; it is "fed" by channels running from south to north.
Its volume is consistent with other estimates of the total volume of
water on Mars.  [Image by MOLA Team]</p>

<center><h2>Water on Mars: Distribution of Water Molecules</h2></center></h2>

This is a map of the fractional content of water molecules in the
upper 1-meter or so of the Martian surface.  It was obtained by the
Gamma Ray Spectrometer experiment on the orbiting Mars Odyssey
spacecraft.  This instrument detects gamma rays emitted by hydrogen
atoms on the surface after they are activated by 
<a href="im/nuclear-rad-from-plansurf.jpg">penetrating cosmic
rays</a>.  Some regions of the surface are quite dry, but most contain
significant water, and both poles are rich in water molecules.  The
gamma-ray technique allows other individual elements to be mapped as
well, including silicon, chlorine, and iron.  [Image from Mars
Odyssey]</p>

<center><h2>Water on Mars: Ice Under the South Pole</h2></center></h2>

This picture shows a map made with the MARSIS ground-penetrating radar
instrument on the Mars Express orbiter (March 2007).  The radar is
reflected from regions up to 13,000 feet below the surface of Mars'
South Pole, and the image shows the thickness of the layers of water
ice.  The black circle is an area without data.  This is the largest
water reservoir yet detected on Mars.  If distributed uniformly over
the Martian surface, it would cover the planet 36 feet deep in liquid
water.  But the flood plains seen on the surface suggest that there
was over 10 times as much water originally present on Mars.  [Image

Spectroscopic measurements of molecular hydrogen</a> in the Martian
atmosphere with the FUSE satellite provide an estimate of the total
volume of water once present on Mars: the equivalent of a global
Martian ocean some 4000 feet deep.  The image above is an artist's
concept of what Mars might have looked like when all its low-lying
areas were filled with water.</p>

<center><h2>Curiosity on Mars</h2></center>

At the left is a self-portrait of "Curiosity," the rover of
NASA's <a href="http://mars.nasa.gov/msl/">Mars Science Lander</a>
mission, at it looked on the surface of Mars in February 2013.  It
carries the most sophisticated set of geophysical analysis instruments
ever sent to another planet.  In a
complex <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki_Af_o9Q9s">landing
sequence</a> Curiosity was placed within 1.5 miles of its intended
landing site in Gale Crater on August 6, 2012.  This 96-mile diameter
crater contains a large central mountain (Aeolis Mons or "Mt. Sharp")
composed of sedimentary rock.  At right is a telephoto view of Aeolis
Mons taken by Curiosity, showing its layered structure.  Curiosity is
exploring the flanks of the mountain.  Click on the images for
enlargements.  To follow Curiosity's progress, check
