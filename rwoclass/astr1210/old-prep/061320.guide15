<h2>A. The "Inferior" Planets</h2>

Mercury and Venus are called <b>"inner"</b> or <b><em>"inferior"</em></b> planets
because they are <b>closer to the Sun</b> than is Earth.</p>

Both revolve around the Sun in shorter times than the Earth (88 and 225 days,
respectively).</p>


<center><img src="im/plan-configs-FB.gif" vspace=10 width=66%></p></center>

<h3> Planet-Sun <em>Configurations</em></h3> </p>

<ul>

<li><b> <em>Elongation</em></b> is the <b>angular distance</b> of a
planet from the Sun as viewed from Earth.  The
term <b>"configurations"</b> refers to the various characteristic
elongations possible for planets as shown in the figure above. </p>

<ul>

<li> As viewed from the Earth, the two planets inside the Earth's
orbit can <b>never</b> appear at large angles from the Sun.  See the
illustration above.  Mercury and Venus always stay within
27<sup>o</sup> and 48<sup>o</sup>, respectively, of the Sun.  These
are their "greatest elongations."  </p>

<li> Consequently, Venus and Mercury are visible in the
sky <a href="im/merc-ven-sunset-horiz-BC.jpg"><b>only near sunset or
sunrise</b></a>.  Venus is the most
common <a href="im/moon-merc-ven-over-paranal-BTafreshi.jpg">evening or morning
"star."</a></p>

<li> An immediate implication of Copernicus' heliocentric model was
that the <b>sizes of the orbits of Mercury and Venus</b> (relative to
Earth's orbit) <b>could be deduced</b> from their greatest
elongations.  In the Ptolemaic model, there was no simple geometric
method for determining the sizes of the planetary orbits.</p>

</ul>

<li> Because Venus' orbital period is similar to Earth's, it tends
to <b>linger</b> in the sky near the horizon for many weeks at a time.  [Recall
the planetarium simulations shown during our discussion of the Maya obsession
with Venus.]</p>

<li> Because of its proximity to Earth and the high albedo (~70%)
produced by its thick cloud layers, Venus is the <b>brightest object in
the sky other than the Sun or the Moon</b>.  Its 
<a href="im/venus-pleiades-2012-MClaro.jpg">intense brightness</a>
and white color make it look artificial. </p>

<ul><ul>

<li> ===> Venus is the classic "Unidentified Flying Object" (<b>UFO</b>).  See
<a href="guide18.html">Guide 18</a> for more discussion.</p>

</ul></ul>

<li> The planets outside Earth's orbit (<b><em>"superior"</em></b> planets),
starting with Mars, can be seen at up to 180<sup>o</sup> from the
Sun.  At that point they are <b>highest in the sky at midnight</b> and are
said to be at <b><em>"opposition"</em></b> with respect to the Sun.</p>

<ul>

<li> As the figure shows, when a planet is at opposition, it is also
<b>nearest the Earth</b> and therefore brightest.  It will also be
undergoing its <b>fastest "retrograde motion"</b> at that point. </p>

</ul>
</ul>

<h2>B. Mercury</h2>

Mercury is hard to observe from Earth because it is above
the nighttime horizon only for brief periods.</p>

<a href="im/polygnotus-basin-region-messenger.jpg"><img
src="im/polygnotus-basin-region-messenger.jpg" align="right" width=25%
hspace=10 vspace=10></a>

It has been <b>less well studied</b> than most other planets.  Until 2007
there had been only 2 spacecraft visits, both flybys, in
contrast to Venus, which has been a major destination of space
missions.
<a href="im/mercury-M10-incomingview.jpg">Here</a> is hemispheric
view of Mercury from Mariner 10 (1974).
</p>

<ul>

 <a href="http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/index.html">MESSENGER</a> was an
elaborate mission (ending in 2015) to study Mercury at close range in
3 <a href="im/MESSENGER_trajectory.svg.jpg" >flybys</a> followed by
long-term in-orbit observations.
</ul>

Mercury has a <b>high average density</b> of 5.4 grams/cc, like Earth,
but Mercury's mass (& therefore gravity compression) is smaller.  That
implies Mercury is <b>more rich in heavy elements</b> than Earth</p>

<!-- 
 <a href="im/merc-near-caloris-lg.jpg" >
-->

Mercury's surface is <b>similar to Earth's Moon</b> (impact-driven terrain),
but with <b>important differences</b> (e.g.  shallower craters) due to
slower cooling and higher gravity.  See the image at right and compare to
Earth's Moon topography
<a href="moontop.html">here</a>.</p>

Mercury's orbit is an <b>important test of <em>General
Relativity</em></b>, the revised interpretation of gravity proposed by
Einstein in 1915.  Mercury's perihelion (the closest point to the Sun
in its elliptical orbit) shifts 43 arc-seconds/century more than
predicted for Newtonian gravity.  This is only 1/10 millionth of its total orbital
motion per orbit, but it can be measured highly accurately over many
orbits.  The extra shift is <b>predicted exactly</b> by Einstein's GR
theory.  </p>

</center>

<h2>C. Venus: Introduction</h2>

Venus is a <b>near "twin"</b> of Earth in global properties:  diameter (95%); mass (82%); distance
from Sun (0.7 AU)</p>

But unlike Earth, <b>thick cloud layers completely obscure its
surface</b>.  See image above (click for enlargement).</p>

<ul> 

<li> The surface of Venus <b>cannot</b> be
studied from outside its atmosphere at optical wavelengths. </p>

<li><b>Clouds</b> in planetary atmospheres are composed of <b>liquid droplets or
ice crystals</b> and are distinct from the atmosphere (<b>gas</b>) in which they
are embedded </p>

<ul>

<li>Therefore, <b>it is difficult to determine cloud composition by
spectroscopy</b> (easy only for vapors). </p>

</ul>

<li> The naive presumption until the 1960's, given Venus' appearance
and overall similarity to the Earth, was that the clouds were made of
water and that the planet probably hosted a <b>flourishing, wet,
jungle-like biosphere</b>.
 </p>

</ul>

USSR & USA space missions to Venus started in 1961 and have included
flybys, orbiters, atmospheric probes, and
short-survival <a href="im/venera-on-Vensurf-artists.jpg">landers</a>.</p>

Results from these missions, as well as Earth-based radio-wave observations,
quickly <b>demolished</b> the notion of a Venusian tropical paradise:</p>

<ul>

Radio and infrared measurements from early flyby and lander
missions (1962-72) showed that Venus' <b>surface temperature was almost
500<sup>o</sup> C (900<sup>o</sup> F) and the lower atmosphere
was crushingly dense</b>. </p>

Landers returned images of a <b>bleak, lava-covered surface</b>: </p>

<center><a href="im/vener13r-surfimage.jpg" ><img

<small><em>Above is a wide angle color image of Venus' surface
returned by the USSR Venera 13 lander (1982).<br>  It shows a
lava-strewn plain, extending to the horizon at right.  The reddish
color is produced<br> by the thick cloud layer, which absorbs blue
light.  Click for enlargement.  </em></small></p>
</center>

</ul>


<p><br></p>

<h2>D. Venus: Surface/Topography</h2>

For Venus, the only feasible surface mapping technique was to
use <b><em>radar</em></b> to penetrate the thick clouds.</p>

<ul>

<a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/magellan/guide5.html"
>Radar systems</a> emit a short <b>burst of radio waves</b>
and then detect the <b>reflected</b> burst to determine a target's distance
and (through the Doppler effect) motion.</p>

<!-- 
Interpreting radar images: brighter regions are more
reflective of radar waves, meaning they are rougher.  Darker
regions are smoother.</p>
-->

</ul>

<center><small><i>Top: elevation maps of Venus and Earth compared.<br>
Bottom: Radar map of Venus with main features labeled. (Pioneer Mission,
1981)</i></small></center></p>


The image above is a relief map of Venus derived from radar
observations with the Pioneer mission.  Best mapping coverage was from
the <a href="http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/magellan/mgn.html" >Magellan
Mission</a> (radar orbiter, 1990-94).</p>

The overall topography is flatter than Earth's.  There are <b>only two "continent"-like
features</b> (Ishtar and Aphrodite in the map above).  </p>

<ul> 

Continents and domelike features are evidence of <b>modest
tectonic</b> activity, but this is <b>much less conspicuous</b> than
on Earth, as can be seen in the comparison images above.  There are no
large-scale plates.</p>

Given the surface temperature, there are obviously <b>no oceans</b> on Venus.</p>


</ul>

Vast <b>lava flows</b> cover 85% of the surface, but there are no
large basins, either impact (like the Moon's marias) or
tectonic-related (like Earth ocean beds).  Most flow regions are
smooth.  But there is little current eruptive activity.</p>

There are many <b>dormant volcanoes</b>, from 500 km diameter to tiny
vents; 3000 over 20 km diameter; 100,000 altogether!  Over 160 larger
than the largest volcano on Earth (Hawaii). </p>

<ul>

<center>
<a href="im/pancake-domes.gif" ><img src="im/pancake-domes-sm.gif" width=55%></a>
</p>

<small><em>This radar image shows four overlapping volcanic domes.
They average about 16 miles in diameter<br> with maximum heights of 2,500
feet. They were produced by eruptions of thick lava coming from vents<br>
on the relatively level ground, allowing the lava to flow in an even
lateral pattern.<br>  Click for enlargement.</em></small> </p>
</center>

</ul>


<a href="im/danilova-lg.gif" ><img src="im/danilova-lg.gif"
alt="DanilovaCrater" align="right" hspace=10, vspace=10 width=25%></a>

There are also <b>many impact craters, but fewer per unit area</b>
than on the Moon or Mercury.  This implies a <b>younger surface</b>
than those planets.</p>

<ul>

<li> Shown at right is a radar image of a 30-mile diameter impact
crater surrounded by a bright "splash blanket" of ejecta.  Lighter-toned
regions on radar images are rougher; darker-toned are smoother. Click 
for a larger view. </p>

</ul>

Surprisingly, Venus shows a <b>uniform distribution of craters</b> across
its surface. </p>

<ul> 

This situation is <b>unique in the Solar System</b> (see discussions
of the <a href="moontop.html">Moon</a> and the outer satellites in
other Guides). </p>

It implies the <b>whole surface formed at one time</b>.  Judged by the
density of impact craters, the surface is relatively young---<b>only
about 500 Myr old</b>, unlike the 4+ Byr-old surfaces of the 
Moon, some outer satellites, etc.</p>

The combined evidence indicates that the entire planet underwent
<b>sudden catastrophic melting & resurfacing</b> about 500 Myr years
ago.  This event was possibly induced by a thick lithosphere which
trapped heat generated in the interior until it built up to a critical
level.  This process could be
<b>cyclic</b>, repeating after sufficient interior heat builds up.  </p>

<li>Venus' surface history will be discussed in the video "Venus
Unveiled."</p>

</ul>

<p><br></p>

<h2>E. Venus: Atmosphere</h2>

Venus' atmosphere is <b>dense, hot, dry, and corrosive</b>.  It is entirely hostile
to Earth-like life. </p>

<ul>

<li> The bulk of the atmosphere is <b>carbon dioxide</b> (CO<sub>2</sub>)</p>

<li> <b>Water is almost absent</b> on Venus.  H<sub>2</sub>O vapor has only
1/10000 of its abundance on Earth, and there is no liquid water on the
surface.  A dessicated planet/atmosphere.  </p>

<ul>

<img align="right" src="im/Ven-atmos-profile-CM.jpg" hspace=10 vspace=10> 

<li> We will find later (<a href="guide19.html" >Study
Guide 19</a>) that the absence of water is a <b>key to the bizarre
properties of the Venusian atmosphere</b>.</p>

<li> Lack of liquid water, which on Earth is a lubricant for the outer
layers of the interior, may also act to <b>inhibit tectonic activity</b> on Venus.</p>

</ul>

<li> The Venusian cloud decks?  The clouds are <b>sulfuric acid(!)</b> droplets</p>

<ul>

<li>  They originate from volcanic outgassing in the absence of rainfall</p>

</ul>

<li>See the atmospheric profile chart at right:</p>

<ul>

<li> There are other <b>remarkable differences from Earth's atmosphere</b></p>

<li> Temperatures and pressures like those at Earth's surface occur at
an altitude of <b>50 km</b> in Venus atmosphere.  Below that, pressures
and temperatures are <b>much higher</b> than on Earth.</p>

<li> The surface temperature is   ~ 750<sup>o</sup>K (480<sup>o</sup>C or 900<sup>o</sup>F)!  </p>

<li> Venus' surface is <b>hotter than Mercury's</b>, despite its
larger distance from the Sun! </p>


<li> The surface pressure is 90x higher than on Earth.  Since gravity
at Venus' surface is almost the same as on the Earth, this implies
Venus' atmosphere is <b>90 times more massive than Earth's</b>!</p>

</ul>
</ul>

Despite the dense and corrosive atmosphere, there is <b>little weathering</b>
of surface features on Venus because windspeeds are very low (and the
sulfuric acid rain evaporates at high altitude before reaching the ground).</b>


<a name="Greenhouse">

<h3>The Greenhouse Effect</h3>

Venus would be warmer than the Earth simply because it is nearer the
Sun.  But the extraordinarily high Venusian temperature is <b>not caused
by higher solar input</b>.  Instead, it is produced by
the <a href="im/greenhouse-effect-okanagan.jpg" ><b><em>Greenhouse
Effect</em></b></a>, an atmospheric process which <b>inhibits surface
cooling</b>.</p>

<ul>

<li> The surface temperature is determined by the <b>equilibrium</b>
point, where the <b>heating rate balances the cooling rate</b>.  If
the cooling rate (i.e. the escape of radiation to space) falls below
the heating rate, the temperature increases until the two match.</p>

<li> The <b>main heat input</b> to any planetary atmosphere (including
Earth's) is from the <b>Sun</b>.  This occurs mainly at <b>visible</b> wavelengths,
where the Sun is brightest.</p>

<a href="im/GHouse-diag-TSmith-uwash.jpg">
<img src="im/GHouse-diag-TSmith-uwash.jpg"
align="right" width=35% vspace=10 hspace=10></a>


<li> <b>Cooling</b> from the surface is by <b>radiation to space</b>.  Because the
temperature of planetary surfaces is (fortunately for us!) much lower
than the Sun's, this occurs not at visible but instead at <b>infrared</b>
wavelengths.</p>

<ul>  (See <a href="121supps2-3.html">Supplements
II and III</a> to remind yourself of the characteristics of radiation
from dense objects like planets.) </p>
</ul>

<li> 
Because all of the surface cooling must take place in the
infrared, <b>any gas that can impede IR radiation acts to
increase the surface temperature</b>.  We call these               
<b>"Greenhouse gases"</b>.  </p>

<li> The most important Greenhouse agents are H<sub>2</sub>O,
CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and O<sub>3</sub>.  Although these
gases are transparent at optical wavelengths, they are 
<a href="im/atmospheric-trans-abs-vs-wavel-Wiki.png">opaque</a> over
large parts of the IR spectrum.  They preferentially <b>absorb
infrared radiation and reflect</b> it back to the planetary
surface, thereby reducing radiative cooling. They act like a blanket
to "trap the heat."  See the sketch above right (click for
enlargement).</p>

<li> This causes a <b>significant temperature rise</b> to the point where the
surface can radiate as much energy to space (despite the Greenhouse
blocking) as it receives from the Sun.  The situation is like the level
of a lake adjusting to the increased height of its outlet dam.</p>

<li> Even <b>tiny amounts</b> of Greenhouse gases 
can have a big effect because they choke the cooling channel.</p>

<ul>
  <a href="im/atmospheric-trans-abs-vs-wavel-Wiki.png">Here</a>
is a chart that shows the radiative input, output, and Greenhouse gas
blocking as a function of wavelength for the Earth's atmosphere.</p>
</ul>

<li> On Earth, where the Greenhouse gases are only <b>"trace"</b> constituents
of the atmosphere (e.g. CO<sub>2</sub> totals only 0.04% of the
atmosphere's mass), the <b>Greenhouse temperature increase to 1950 was
a modest 30</b><sup>o</sup><b> C (or 54</b><sup>o</sup><b> F)</b>, which is
just enough to keep Earth's surface "comfortable" by human standards
and <b>prevent the oceans from freezing over</b>.</p>

<li>But on Venus, where the atmosphere is almost pure CO<sub>2</sub>
and massive enough to block large regions of the infrared spectrum,
the
<b>temperature rise is 400</b><sup>o</sup><b> C</b>.</p>

<li> The existence of a Greenhouse Effect for Earth's atmosphere was
first recognized almost two centuries ago, in the 1820's.  The first
quantitative discussion was <b>published in 1896</b> by the Swedish
physicist
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_climate_change_science">
Arrhenius</a>, who predicted that human industrial activity might be
able to produce enough CO<sub>2</sub> to increase the temperature of
Earth's surface.  Evidence of human-induced increases in both atmospheric
CO<sub>2</sub> and temperature would not be clear for another 100 years
(see <a href="guide19.html">Guide 19</a>).
</p>
</ul>

<p><br></p>

<h2>F.  Venus and Earth</h2>

Venus is a <b>sobering lesson</b> in comparative planetology.</p>

The incredible differences between terrestrial and Venusian conditions
were a great shock to astronomers.  How can the atmospheres of Venus
and Earth, despite their similarities in size and mass be so
different?  The culprit is probably the seemingly <b>small difference
in distance to the Sun</b> (30%), as we will see
in <a href="guide19.html">Study Guide 19</a>.  </p>

<ul>

Venus is totally unsuitable for a biosphere for <b>two</b> entirely different
reasons:  its hostile atmosphere and its episodes of catastrophic
resurfacing (both related to heat-trapping).</p>

It is ironic that this horrific world was named in many cultures for
the Goddess of Love.  The Maya, who believed it was a vicious god bent
on destruction, were closer to the truth.</p>

But Venus provided another astronomical touchstone for human societies.  It was
the recognition of the power of the Greenhouse Effect on Venus that
first led atmospheric scientists to become concerned about
<a href="guide19.html#globwarm"><b>global warming</b></a> on Earth.</p>
