<h3>Pseudo-science</h3>

<ul>

"Pseudo-scientific" investigations fall at the margins of science.
They are often devoted to topics of some popular interest -- such as
<a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/astrology.html">astrology</a>
or <a href="guide18.html">"unidentified flying objects" (UFOs)</a> in
the case of astronomy -- but which have either not yet been validated
by mainstream science or have been rejected by it.</p>


Advocates of pseudo-scientific investigations apply <b>some, but not
all, of the established methods of science</b>.  These <b>fall
short</b> of the basic criteria listed above in important ways.  They
always involve a <b>lack of adequate evidence</b> and frequently
contradict validated principles of science.  But they have credibility
for many people because they resemble science, and this opens a large
arena for human folly.  </p>

We will discuss pseudo-science further, and the "UFO phenomenon" as an
example, later in <a href="guide18.html">Study Guide 18</a>.</p>

Prominent <b>examples</b> of pseudoscience: astrology, extra-sensory
perception (ESP), psychic forecasts, telekinesis, UFO abductions,
ghosts, the Bermuda Triangle, Atlantis and other ancient
super-civilizations, personal reinterpretations of major scientific
theories like relativity or quantum mechanics.  Also, much
"alternative" medicine.  </p>


Hallmarks: uncritical acceptance of poorly documented phenomena; lack
of experiments or inadequate experimental controls; inexperienced
observers; logical fallicies; non-repeatability; often self-deception;
often for-profit publicity/entertainment; sometimes deliberate fraud.</p>

The evidence is <b>always inadequate</b>: 
</p>

<ul>

The issue is not that there are no good scientific <b>explanations</b>
for claimed pseudo-scientific phenomena.  At any time, there
are <b>thousands of well-documented phenomena</b> that science does
not properly understand.  These are what active scientists devote
their careers to studying.  By contrast, in the case of pseudo-science
many of the phenomena themselves have <b>not been demonstrated to
exist by objective experimentation or observational evidence</b>.</p>

<ul> For instance, we <b>know</b> that penicillin kills certain types
of dangerous bacteria.  But no one has ever convincingly been shown to
be able to read someone else's mind.</p> </ul>

If credible evidence emerges
for any of the marginal "pseudo" areas, they will then receive
mainstream scientific attention.   </p>

</ul>

A <b>central failure</b> of pseudo-science is that it almost always involves
a <b>lack of consistency</b> with established scientific principles or facts
(e.g. foreseeing the future contradicts the verified principles of
special relativity).  </p>


Most pseudo-science is harmless, except for the sloppy thinking and
miseducation it encourages.  But some pseudo-science poses tangible
<b>threats</b> to you and society.  For example:</p>

<ul>

Fraudulent or ineffective "alternative" health-care (such
as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMGIbOGu8q0&feature=related">homeopathy</a>,
in which the active therapeutic ingredients are diluted to the point
where not a single molecule remains).</p>

Rejection of proven beneficial medical protocols or treatments, like
vaccines, because of personal or political agendas.  These were
especially harmful, and resulted in the unnecessary deaths of hundreds
of thousands of people in the US alone, during the
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9282830/"> COVID-19
pandemic</a>.  </p>

criminal prosecutions</a> (murder, child abuse, satanic rituals, etc.)
based on erroneous psychotherapy (e.g.
<a href="im/recovered-memory-alien-Doonesbury.gif">
"suppressed" memories</a> "recovered" by hypnosis).  </p>
