 The recent development of vaccines for the COVID-19 virus is a
 perfect example of how basic research underpins essential
 technology. With older technology, it normally took years to perfect
 viral vaccines. However, the discovery of the structure and function
 of the "messenger RNA" molecule in 1961 began a chain of research
 that ultimately led to the very rapid development, in only a few
 months' time, of COVID-19 vaccines that use mRNA to induce human
 immune system resistance to the virus.
