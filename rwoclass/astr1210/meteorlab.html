<h3>A.  BACKGROUND  </h3>



Meteors are bits of cosmic debris (icy or rocky) which, while
following their paths through space, happen to encounter the Earth.
The intense heat generated by friction as they rush through the
atmosphere causes them to glow.  They range in size from objects as
small as grains of sand to larger rocks weighing several hundred
pounds or more.  Usually they are completely vaporized and vanish in a
streak of light.  <em>Fireballs</em> are very bright meteors which may
light up the entire landscape.  Fireballs may exhibit sudden bursts of
light or explode.  Any objects which survive the heat of entry and
strike the Earth's surface are referred to as <em>meteorites</em>.  </p>

Meteors originate primarily from comets, being the debris swept
out of the comet nucleus by particles and radiation from the Sun.  As
a comet orbits the Sun, it leaves a trail of particles behind, which
also orbit the Sun along the comet's path.  Periodically, the Earth
may intersect a comet orbit along which swarms of such particles are
moving, causing an unusually large number of meteors to enter the
atmosphere.  Such an event is referred to as a <em>meteor shower</em>.
Since the particles are spread out around the comet's orbit, and the
Earth may spend some time in the vicinity as it orbits the Sun, these
showers can last several nights, usually with a well-defined peak of activity
occurring somewhere in the interval.  Because all the meteors in a
swarm are moving parallel to each other through space, it will appear
to an observer watching them that they are all diverging from a single
point in the sky.  That is, from the observer's perspective, the
objects appear at the point called in drafting the "vanishing point"
and appear to diverge from this point as they get closer (the
"railroad track effect").  This point is called the shower
<em>radiant</em> and is designated by the constellation in which it
appears to lie.  </p>

In addition to ice and dust particles moving in swarms, interplanetary space
is filled with a widely distributed thin cloud of dust.  This is due
to the gradual breakup and dispersal of swarms.  These other 
particles intersect the Earth at random times and in random
directions, giving rise to a "background" of <em>sporadic</em> meteors
unassociated with showers.  Under clear, dark sky conditions, you could
see perhaps 10-20 sporadic meteors per hour, mostly not terribly
bright.  </p>

<h3>B. THE LEONID SHOWER </h3>

One of the most famous meteor showers is the <em>Leonid</em> shower,
which is associated with a relatively inconspicuous periodic comet
named Tempel-Tuttle.  Its radiant is in the well-known constellation
Leo (the lion), which at this time of year is in the eastern
sky after midnight. </p>

There are strong concentrations of debris along the path of this
comet, and every 33 years or so, these can produce unsually good
displays.  There have occasionally been spectacular Leonid <em>meteor
storms</em>, with meteor rates higher than 1000 per hour.  The last
was in 1966.  It is possible that such a storm will occur this year or
next.  The peak time for the display is predicted to be the nights of
November 16 and 17 (mornings of Nov. 17 and 18). </p>

information on the upcoming Leonid shower and how to observe it, see

<h3>C. OBSERVATIONS</h3>

You will have to observe starting around 2 AM on the mornings of
Nov. 17 or 18.  If the weather is cloudy or hazy, there is probably
no point in trying the lab.</p>  

You are to observe the shower for at least one hour, noting the
location, direction, and brightness of the meteors you see.</p>

You will need:</p>

<ul>

<li>  A watch and pencil or pen.</p>

<li> A constellation chart showing the relevant part of the sky.  The
easiest way to obtain one is to get the Constellation Quiz chart for
<em>March</em> from the Astronomy Lab Room.  (It's a good idea to take two
with you.) A clipboard or similar writing surface will be very
helpful.  You will need several other pieces of paper or a notebook as
well.</p>

<li>  A flashlight, preferably with a red filter.</p>

<li>  Suitable warm clothing---you will get very cold sitting still
even if the temperature is 50 degrees.  </p>

<li> You do not need binoculars to observe meteors (since you want
to see as much of the sky as you can at all times), but if you have
a pair, bring it along just to look at other things in the sky.</p>

</ul>

You must have a <em>clear</em>, <em>dark</em> sky, which means you
will have to observe from some convenient and dark, but safe, place
<em>outside of town.</em> Don't observe alone.  Pick a location where
you can see the eastern half of the sky (and preferably all) without
any obstruction.</p>

Enter in your notes the <em>date</em> and the <em>times</em> at which
you started and stopped observing, your observing <em>site</em>, and the
<em>area of the sky</em> observed.  Also note the presence of clouds,
artificial lights, moonlight, etc., which might interfere with your
observations.  </p>

For every meteor you see,</p>

<ul>

<li>  Draw, on the constellation chart, its approximate track on
the sky.</p>

<li>  Note in small letters next to the track:  "B" for bright;
"M" for medium; "F" for faint.  The scale you use should be based
on the brightest, typical, and faintest stars you can see.  </p>

<li>  Separately record any unusual behavior---e.g. a fireball,
smoke trail, unusual colors, sounds, etc.</p>

<li>  Keep track of the time and note the total number of meteors
you see every 15 minutes during your observing session.  </p>

</ul>

If the rate of meteors is so high that all of the above data cannot be
observed and recorded in the intervals between events, do the
following:</p>

<ul>

<li>  For 15 minutes,  keep an accurate count. </p>

<!-- in the three brightness categories.  -->

<li>  For the next 15 minutes, chart the locations and directions of 
typical meteors.  Then repeat.</p>

</ul>

<h3>D. WRITEUP</h3>

<ul>

<li> For each 15 minute interval you observed, compute the mean number
of meteors seen per minute.</p>

<li> Use your chart of meteor tracks to estimate the fraction of all
meteors you saw which were probably sporadic (i.e. those not related
to the Leonid shower).</p>

<li> Estimate the location of the radiant of the shower meteors from
the chart.  Circle and label it.</p>

</ul>

Turn in your notes, constellation chart, and writeup. </p>

If the shower wasn't very good this year, remember to try again next
year.  Peak shower rates are very hard to forecast. </p>
