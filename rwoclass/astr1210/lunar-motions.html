The Moon is the most conspicuous of the denizens of the
night sky, and for several nights each month completely dominates the
sky, so it always was of major interest to ancient astronomers.  Its
motion from day-to-day against the star background is
also <b>faster</b> (about <b>13 degrees per day</b>) than those of the
Sun or planets and can be followed easily without the need
for complicated instruments.  </p>

Because it orbits the Earth rather than the Sun and is very
nearby by planetary standards, the Moon is associated with 
a number of unique phenomena, some of which are quite dramatic.</p>

The <i><b>lunar phases</b></i> are the most obvious of the important
cyclic phenomena associated with the Moon.  Others
are <i><b>eclipses</b></i> (two types), changing positions of
<b>north/south maximum distances</b> from the celestial equator, and polar
<i><b>precession</b></i>, all of which we discuss here, and
the <i><b>tides</b></i>, which are covered
in <a href="guide13.html#tides">Study Guide 13</a>.</p>

All ancient cultures must have been aware of the phases and eclipses.
(Precession is too subtle to detect without careful observations, and
tides are only obvious along coastlines.)  Although the Greeks were
the first to arrive at the explanation of them (around 500 BC), others
left traces of their fascination with them.  </p>

<!-- There is good evidence that the most
remarkable of the ancient megalithic monuments, 
<a href="guide05.html"><b>Stonehenge</b></a>,
incorporated knowledge of lunar cycles.   -->

<p></br></p>

<a name="phases"></a>
<h2> A. Lunar Phases</h2>

Unlike the planets and stars, the Moon is perceptibly extended
on the sky to the unaided eye.  Throughout a given month, the Moon
exhibits <b>drastic changes in apparent shape, from crescent to
round</b> and back.  

<a href="im/moon-phases-lrg-cidadao.jpg"><img src="im/moon-phases-lrg-cidadao-sm.jpg"
align="right" width=25% hspace=12 vspace=12></a>

The shapes are called <b><em>phases</em></b> of the
Moon.  Overall lunar <b>brightness</b> changes in proportion to
the bright area.  .</p>

<ul>

<li> A montage of photographs of the lunar phases during a month is
shown at the right.  Click for an enlargement.</p>

<li> Other than the apparent daily and annual motions of the Sun, the
lunar phases are the <b>most dramatic</b> of the cycles visible in the
sky.  The Moon repeats its phases after a period of <b>29.5
days</b>. </p>

<li> Lunar phases were especially <b>important</b> before the invention of
artificial lighting, because the Moon's brightness directly affected
people's ability to move around at night.  Phases near "full" Moon
produce very considerable <b>illumination</b> of the Earth's surface.
That's a benefit for normal human activity.  But in compensation,
scattered Moonlight in the atmosphere at those times is sufficient to
<b>conceal</b> all but the brightest planets and stars from easy
visibility.</p>

</ul>

Ancient societies had many colorful supernatural explanations for the
lunar phases (e.g. regular consumption and regurgitation of the Moon
by a giant celestial sow).  But only one of them arrived at the right
answer: <b>the Greeks</b>, who understood the phases as early
as <b>500 BC</b>.  </p>

<ul>

<li> <b>The key clue is that the phase of the Moon correlates directly
with its angular distance from the Sun</b> in the sky.  The Moon is
"rounder" the farther from the Sun it is in angular distance.  See
this <a href="im/lunar-phases-at-sunset-Seeds34c.jpg"> illustration</a>,
which shows the phases and location of the Moon at sunset during the
first two weeks of a lunar cycle.  The Sun is always at the western
horizon -- i.e. Sunset -- at the times shown.</p>

<li> Having invented <b>solid geometry</b>, the Greeks realized that
this behavior implies that <b>the Moon is a sphere, in orbit
around the Earth, half of which is always illuminated by the Sun.</b>
It is not self luminous and shines only by <b>reflected light</b>.</p>

<li>
The <b>fraction of the sunlit hemisphere</b> which we can see from Earth
at any time determines the lunar phase then.</p>

</ul>

<font color="blue"><b>Our modern understanding</b></font> of
the Moon is as follows:

<ul>

<li> As in the case of the planets (see <a href="guide05.html">Study
Guide 5</a>), the apparent motions on the sky of the Moon are
a <b>composite</b> of its <b>intrinsic</b> motion in its orbit and the
motion of our <b>observing platform</b>, the Earth.</p>

<li> The Moon is the only (large) natural satellite of Earth, moving
in a modestly elliptical orbit with an average radius of 238,000 miles
(384,000 km).  Its
<b><em>sidereal</em></b> orbital period with respect to the "fixed" stars is
<b>27.3 days</b>.  It <b>moves eastward</b> in its orbit as viewed
from Earth, about 13 degrees per day (changing rise/set times by about 50
minutes per day).  The lunar orbit is <b>tilted</b> slightly (5 degrees)
out of the ecliptic plane. </p>

<li> The situation is shown in the figure above and
in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXMrlO0NvO8">this
video.</a>
In the figure you are looking down on the Earth's North
Pole.  The Earth spins <b>counterclockwise</b> (in 24 hours), and the
Moon orbits counterclockwise (in 29.5 days).  The <b>fraction</b> of
the Moon's sunlit hemisphere which we can see from Earth determines
the lunar phase on a given day.  </p>

<li> We see a "full," <em>"crescent," "gibbous,"</em> or dark ("new")
Moon depending on the <b>angle between the Sun and Moon as viewed
from Earth</b>.  The terms "waxing" or "waning" in the diagram refer to
whether the visible illuminated portion of the Moon is increasing or
decreasing with date.  </p>

<!-- An alternative version of the diagram above, with
photographs of the Moon's appearance at each phase, is
available <a href="im/moon-phases-photos-CM.jpg" >here</a>. -->

<li> The diagram shows that a "first quarter" (or "half-full") Moon
is 90<sup>o</sup> away (east) from the Sun in the sky and that a full
Moon is 180<sup>o</sup> away from the Sun.  The Moon will be in a
crescent phase when is it less than 90<sup>o</sup> away from the Sun
and a gibbous phase when between 90<sup>o</sup> and
180<sup>o</sup> away.  The Moon spends about two weeks of each month
in each of those conditions.</p>

<li> <a href="im/lunation-anim.gif" ><img src="im/film.gif"> This 
time lapse video</a> composed of still
photographs of the Moon during a 29.5 day cycle vividly illustrates
the relationship between shadowing and phases.  The changes in the
apparent size of the Moon and the slight "rocking" motion (known as
<em>libration</em>) are caused by the fact that the lunar orbit is
 non-circular in shape.</p>

<li> Because Earth moves in its own orbit around the Sun, the Moon
does not return to the same position with respect to the Sun as seen
from Earth (e.g. 180 degrees away from Sun) for 29.5 days, <b>2.2 days
longer</b> than its sidereal period.  This is called
its <b><em>synodic</em></b> period. The situation is
shown <a href="im/synodic-v-sidereal-month-Eskridge.jpg">here</a>.</p>

<li> The Moon repeats its phases after its synodic period of 29.5
days, which is the basis for our <b>calendrical "month"</b>.  The
phases are almost, but not quite, synchronous with our calendrical
months (of 28, 30, or 31 days).  The phase of the moon on a given day
of the month therefore shifts systematically throughout the year and
from one year to the next.</p>

<li> In a more subtle background cycle, the orientation of the Moon's
orbit with respect to the ecliptic changes over an <b>18.6 year
period</b>, which affects the dates of the maximum/minimum excursions
of the Moon from the celestial equator and the timing of eclipses (see
below).</p>
</ul>

<font color="blue"><b>Technical Note:</b></font></p>

<ul>

<li> You can use the figure above to determine the <b>time of day</b>
when the Moon in a given phase will rise, transit, or set.  Use the
concept of the horizon plane, and note that the marked positions A, B,
C, and D correspond to places where observers experience noon, sunset,
midnight, and sunrise, respectively.</p>

<li> For instance, drawing a horizon plane at B (a flat line, just
touching the Earth's surface at the observer's position) allows you to
infer that a first quarter Moon will transit at sunset; a full Moon
rises at sunset; and a waning gibbous Moon is not visible at sunset
(because it is below the horizon and not yet risen).  </p>

</ul>

<a name="precession"> </a>
<h2>B. Polar Precession </h2>

<b><em>Precession</em></b> is a motion of the Earth, not the Moon, but it is
partly induced by the Moon's motion in its orbit.  It is
a <b>cyclical, long-period wobble</b> in the <b>orientation of the
Earth's polar axis</b> projected on the celestial sphere.  This
is shown schematically in the animation at the right.  </p>

<ul>

<li> Precession is produced by the combined <b>gravity of the Moon &
Sun</b> acting on the "bulge" at Earth's equator.  This results in a
gradual cyclical change in the direction on the celestial sphere
toward which the Earth's poles point.  Precessional effects
are <b>very slow</b>; the polar cycle lasts <b>26,000 years</b>,
corresponding to an average shift in stellar positions on the sky of
only about <b>0.5 degree per century</b>.</p>

<li> Though subtle, precession was first detected in <b>150 BC</b> by
the Greek astronomer <b>Hipparchos</b> through comparison of measured
star positions over several centuries. </p>

<center>
<a href="im/precess-NS.gif"><img src="im/precess-NS.gif" alt="Polar Precession" width=50%
vspace=15></a>
</center>

<li> As shown in the drawing above, <b>Polaris</b> is a
convenient <b>"North Pole Star"</b> now and lies about 1 degree from
the true North Celestial Pole.  However, because of precession it will
not be near the pole in a few 1000 years.  The bright star Vega will
be close to the pole 12,000 years from now -- but most of the time
there is <b>NO useful pole star</b>.  The animation below shows how
the northern constellations change location with respect to the pole
over a period of 11,000 years. (Note: the point labeled "zenith" in
the drawing is actually the "North Pole".)</p>

<center>
 <a href="im/pole-on-sky-vtime-SRAnderson.gif">
<img src="im/pole-on-sky-vtime-SRAnderson.gif" width="60%"
vspace=15></a></center>


<li> Precession causes changes in the <b>positions of all stars</b> with respect
to the celestial poles and equator.  The maximal change in the angle
between the pole and a given star is 47<sup>o</sup>.  This means that
many stars in the southern hemisphere, which now are always below the
horizon from Charlottesville, will become visible at some time in the
future, and other familiar stars will shift out of view.
</p>

<li> Precession changes the location of the intersections between the
ecliptic and the equator (i.e. the <b>equinoxes</b>) in the stellar reference
frame.  E.g. the Vernal Equinox moves from one constellation of the
Zodiac to the next in about 2150 years.  </p>

<li>Precession is a complication in interpreting ancient astronomical
observatories because it <b>causes misalignments between the original
building sight lines and the current-day positions of stars</b>.  We
must take it into account in interpreting ancient structures.</p>

<li> <font color="blue"><b>Technical note:</font></b> Precession causes the
<a href="https://rwoconne.github.io/rwoclass/astr1230/motions-coords.html">
Right Ascension and Declination coordinates</a> of all astronomical
objects to continually change slowly.  The maximum annual change is
about 10 seconds of time in RA and 20 seconds of arc in DEC.  All
listings of RA,DEC must have the "epoch" -- i.e.  the date for which
they are valid -- specified.  Most listings now give epoch 2000
coordinates.
 </p>
</ul>

<h2>C. Eclipses (Dark Shadows) </h2>


Eclipses are <b>shadow effects</b> in which either the Sun or the Moon
appears to "go out" for a time.  Both can be beautiful and dramatic
events for properly situated observers on Earth.  In
particular, <b>total solar eclipses have tremendous psychological
impact</b> because the Sun seems to disappear in the middle of an
ordinary day with no guarantee of return.  The sudden extinguishing of
the Sun can be terrifying for people who believe the Sun is a living
god if they could not predict it in advance. </p>

 The picture at the top of the page shows a series of photographs
taken before, during, and after a total solar eclipse.</p>

<ul> 

<li> There are <b>two types</b> of eclipses: <i><b>lunar</b></i>
and <i><b>solar</b></i>.  They are produced by <b>shadows</b> cast by
the Earth and the Moon, respectively.</p>

<ul>

<li> A <b>lunar eclipse</b> occurs when the shadow of the <b>Earth</b>
strikes the <b>Moon</b></p>

<li> A <b>solar eclipse</b> occurs when the shadow of the <b>Moon</b>
strikes the <b>Earth</b></p>

</ul>

<li> The geometry of the two kinds of eclipses is illustrated in
the following diagrams.  (Click for enlargements):  </p>

<em><small>Solar Eclipse Geometry</small></em>
</center>

<p><br></p>

<li> Referring to these illustrations and the 
<a href="#phase_diagram">diagram above</a>
concerning the phases of the Moon, we see that:</p>

<ul><ul>

<li> A <b>lunar eclipse</b> can <b>only</b> occur near <b>Full Moon</b>, and</p>

<li> A <b>solar eclipse</b> can <b>only</b> occur near <b>New Moon</b> </p>

</ul></ul>

<li> The core of the shadow, where solar light is totally blocked, is
called the <b><i>umbra</i></b>.  The umbra is shown as the dark cone in the
diagrams above.  It is surrounded by a larger region (lighter gray
above) with partial blocking, called the <i>penumbra</i>.  Eclipses
can therefore be either <b><em>"total"</em></b> or
<b><em>"partial"</em></b>, depending on which part of the shadow 
is involved.</p>

</ul>

<em><small>Two solar eclipses.  (Left) Total eclipse in March 1970 from Virginia.
<br>(Right)  Annular eclipse in May 2012 from Texas (J. Thumberger).</small></em>
</center>

<h3>Solar Eclipses</h3></p>

<ul>

<li> As viewed from Earth, the Moon has an angular diameter of about <b>0.5
degrees</b>.  This is almost exactly the <b>same</b> as
the Sun's. </p>  

<ul>
This similarity of apparent size is merely a <b>coincidence</b>, a
product of the present-day size of the Moon's orbit (which is
continually changing slowly).  The Moon and Sun have, of course,
vastly different <b>intrinsic</b> sizes. </p>
</ul>

<li> This coincidence of sizes permits the occurrence of <i><b>total
solar eclipses</b></i> on the Earth. In a total eclipse, the umbra of
the Moon's shadow touches the surface of the Earth, as shown in the
Solar Eclipse Geometry diagram above.  As seen from locations inside
the umbra, the Moon <b>just barely blocks all of the bright surface of
the Sun</b>.  The umbra covers only
a <a href="im/eclipse-shadow-on-Earth-052112-MTSAT.jpg">small part</a>
of the Earth's surface at any time, but

<img src="im/Tecl94anim.gif" align="right" width=25% vspace=10 hspace=10>

as the Moon moves in its orbit, the
umbra <a href="im/umbra-motion-tot-sol-eclipse-110313-anim.gif">sweeps
across</a> the Earth, producing an elongated strip within which a
total eclipse is experienced.
</p>

<li>At the right is a time lapse video of a total solar eclipse.  The Moon
crosses in front of the Sun from right to left.  Just as totality
is beginning, the exposure time of the camera was increased and shows
the "diamond ring" effect produced by the last small uncovered parts of
the solar surface.
</p>

<li> For viewers situated in the penumbra, only <b>part</b> of the Sun's surface
is blocked by the Moon, producing a <i><b>partial solar
eclipse</b></i>.  Observable effects can be detected without optical
aid for eclipse fractions larger than about 5%.  <b><i>"Annular"
eclipses</i></b> are produced when the Moon appears to lie entirely
within the Sun's surface; this can occur when the Moon is near its
apogee (farthest from Earth in its orbit).</p>

<li> Partial eclipses are much less dramatic than are total eclipses
because even a small uncovered fraction of the Sun's surface produces
large amounts of light; however, they <b>last longer</b>, are more
frequent, and can be seen from a <b>larger part of the Earth's
surface</b>.</p>


<center><img src="im/eclipse-coronal-streamers-chromosphere.jpg" width=70%

<br>(Right) Chromosphere showing (red) prominences during August 1999 eclipse
(L. Viatour).</small></em></center></p>


<li>During a total solar eclipse, when the tremendously bright surface
of the Sun is just blocked by the Moon, we can observe the very
faint structures surrounding the Sun's surface (called the
<b><i>"chromosphere"</i></b> and <b><i>"corona"</i></b>) that are
normally hidden in the glare.</p>

<ul>

The corona is the irregular white halo surrounding the darkened Sun in
the left hand frame of the picture above.  You can also see the inner
corona in the video above (a thin annular glow during totality).  The
chromosphere is the region just above the Sun's surface in the right
hand frame of the picture above.  The red color of the
flamelike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_prominence"><i>prominences</i></a>
extending above the solar surface gives the chromosphere
("color"-sphere) its name. </p>

Although special telescope designs can reject much of the light of the
solar surface, total solar eclipses still offer the best views of the
inner solar atmosphere for ground-based telescopes, so they are
very important events scientifically.</p>

</ul>

<li>Total solar eclipses last at most <b>7 minutes</b> at a given
location and are visible <a href="im/eclipse-paths-CM.jpg"><b>only in
a narrow strip</b></a> on the Earth's surface.  The umbral shadow
moves along the strip at a speed of about 1500 mph.  Because of the
narrow path, relatively few people are able to experience a given
total eclipse. </p>

<!--

src="im/film.gif"></a> Click on the icon for a video [650 KB] of the
Moon's shadow crossing the Earth during an eclipse.</p> </ul>
-->

<li> If the Moon were more distant from Earth, such that the Sun
appeared much larger than the Moon, there would never be total solar
eclipses.  And if the Moon were nearer, so that it appeared much
larger than the Sun, total solar eclipses would last longer and be
more frequent, though they would be much less interesting
aesthetically and scientifically.</p>

<li> Perhaps the most widely viewed total solar eclipse in history was
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_August_21,_2017">
<b>"Great American Eclipse"</b></a> of 21 August 2017, during which
the umbra sliced across the United States from the Oregon coast to
South Carolina in about 90 minutes.  Because of tremendous media
coverage, millions of people traveled to the eclipse path.  Over 200
million people were estimated to have watched the eclipse, either in
total or partial phase.  
<a href="im/eclipse-USA-aug17-mosaic.jpg">Here</a> is a mosaic
of eclipse event pictures.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Lunar Eclipses</h3></p>

<ul>

<li> Lunar eclipses can also be total or partial, depending on the
exact path of the Moon through the Earth's shadow cones (see
<a href="im/luneclipse-022108-diag-Espenak.gif">this chart</a> of the
Moon's track during a typical total eclipse). </p>

<!-- <a href="im/total-lunar-eclipse-aug08-3ims.jpg"><img src="im/luneclipse1292-thumb.gif"
align="right" width=15% vspace=10 hspace=10> </a>
-->

<li> During a total lunar eclipse, the Moon will become very dim.  But
residual sunlight passing through dust layers in Earth's atmosphere
often tints the Moon bloody red, as in the picture below.  Click 
<a href="im/total-lunar-eclipse-aug08-3ims.jpg">here</a>
 for an enlarged view of an eclipse.</p>

<li> By contrast with a total solar eclipse, a total lunar eclipse can
last up to <b>1.5 hours</b> and is visible from about <b>1/2 of the
Earth's surface</b>.  Most of Earth's inhabitants (with astronomical
interests) have therefore seen lunar eclipses.  </p>
</ul>

<p><br></p>

<h2>D.  Eclipse Prediction </h2>

The basic geometry of eclipses is simple, but predicting their
occurrence and type (total, partial, annular) depends on
understanding the complex nature of the lunar orbit:  </p>

<ul>

<li> <a href="im/eclipse-shadow-scales.jpg"><b>Almost
perfect alignment</b></a> of the Sun, the Moon and the Earth is needed for
an eclipse.</p>

<li>  The Earth and Sun lie (by definition) in the ecliptic plane
and therefore the Moon <b>must also be in that plane</b> for an eclipse
to occur. (Hence, the origin of the word <i><b>"ecliptic."</b></i>)</p>

<li>If the Moon's orbit lay exactly in the plane of the ecliptic and were
perfectly circular, there would be a total eclipse of the Sun and a
total eclipse of the Moon at each new and full Moon,
respectively, <b>each month</b>.  Eclipses would be routine celestial
phenomena, and the psychological impact of solar eclipses would
greatly diminish.</p>

<li> But the Moon's orbit is <b>tilted 5 degrees out of the ecliptic
plane</b> and only crosses the plane at two points, called
the <i><b>nodes</b></i>.  The Moon moves through the two nodes once
each month.  </p>

<ul>

5 degrees sounds small, but remember that it is <b>10 times</b> the angular
diameter of the Moon.</p>

</ul>

<li> Therefore, the Moon <b>must be</b> near one of its
nodes <b>and</b> that node must lie almost directly on the line
running from the Sun through the Earth for eclipses to occur. </p>

<ul>

<li> Viewed on the celestial sphere from the Earth, the node is where the
Moon's celestial path crosses the ecliptic.  See the diagram below
(click for enlargement).  Only if the Sun and Moon are <b>both near the
node at the same time</b> can a solar eclipse occur.  If the Sun and Moon
are both close to the node but the alignment is not perfect, a
partial eclipse will occur, as in the figure.</p>

<center><a href="im/proj-orbits-soleclipse-seeds.jpg"><img
src="im/proj-orbits-soleclipse-seeds-ex.jpg" width=50% vspace=12></a></center></p>

<li> During the few days immediately before and after a solar eclipse
the Moon (a thin crescent) is very hard to see in the sky.  Cultures
without a practical understanding of astronomy could be taken unawares
by a solar eclipse and fall into panic at the darkening of the Sun.</p>

</ul>

<li> The direction to a node on the celestial sphere (i.e. with respect
to the stars) changes, but only slowly.  Good alignments between the <em>"line
of nodes"</em> and the Sun-Earth line therefore only occur at approximately
<b>6-month intervals</b>.  [Equivalently, once the Sun has passed one
node along its ecliptic path, it will not approach the other for 6
months.] </p>

<li> The perspective drawing below shows the
orientation of the Moon's orbit in 3-D space.  Eclipses occur <b>only</b> near
those times when the <b>line of nodes points near the Sun</b> (called
<b>"eclipse seasons"</b> and marked "favorable for eclipse" in the
drawing).  On average, there are <b>2 solar and 2 lunar eclipses each
year</b>.  </p>

<center><a href="im/eclipse-seasons-Wads.gif"><img src="im/eclipse-seasons-Wads.gif"
width=66% alt="Eclipse Seasons"></a></center>

<p><br></p>

<li> Because of gravitational interactions between the Moon and Sun,
the line of nodes of the Moon's orbit <b>moves</b> with time,
taking <b>18.6 years</b> to make a complete rotation around the Earth.
This produces a 18.6-year-long sequence of eclipses called
the <b><em>saros cycle</em></b>.</p>

<ul>

During the cycle, solar and lunar eclipses occur roughly <b>every 6
months</b>.  But the pattern of months in which eclipses occur change and
don't repeat for about 19 years.</p>

The dates and paths on the Earth's surface for solar eclipses 
from 2000 to 2020 are shown <a href="im/eclipse-paths-CM.jpg">here</a>.
</p>

</ul>


<li> The change in the line of nodes also produces
<b>changes in the extreme northerly or southerly positions</b> of the
Moon as seen from Earth in a given month by <b>+/- 5 degrees</b>.  This
affects, for instance, the duration of a moonlit night, so that the
cycle can be recognized without necessarily observing eclipses.  The
saros cycle was known to many ancient astronomers, including
those who helped build Stonehenge (see <a href="guide05.html">Study
Guide 5</a>). </p>

<li> More variety is thrown into the character of eclipses by the fact
that the Moon's orbit is <b>elliptical</b> in shape, meaning that
the Moon can be at different distances from the Earth during eclipse
seasons; when it is farther from Earth, an annular rather
than a total eclipse can occur.</p>
