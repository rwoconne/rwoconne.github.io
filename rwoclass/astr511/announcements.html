12/3/03:  

The PS4 deadline is extended to Friday, 12/5.

Based on questions posed to me, here are
a few hints on PS4

#2:  "high temperature" here means effectively infinite temperature
       (the text is quoting asymptotic colors).  Remember to convert
       to the Vega system [you can test your conversion by using the
       supplied VEGA SED---tho answers won't be exact since you are
       approximating each filter as a delta function].

#3:  refer to Lecture 4 on the eqn of transfer

#4:  note that you are instructed to ignore a number of complicating
     effects but NOT to ignore readout noise.  

#6:  something very similar to this was demonstrated in class in
     Lecture 6, and the journal file from that IDL session is
     linked to the Lectures page

     Be sure to CLEARLY EXPLAIN the logic of your outlier-rejection
     technique.  Your technique should be general---i.e. it should not
     depend on the specific values present in this particular synthetic
     image.  

#6 & #7:  the arguments of IDL functions and procedures can be
          scalars, vectors, or arrays.  When you need to compute
          a long set of numbers, it obviously makes more sense
          to use vectors rather than scalars.

          E.g. in the 40-in exposure time problem, the simplest
	  approach is to enter a vector for the stellar magnitudes and
	  write the routine to return a vector of exposure times.  The
	  first step in the routine would be to determine the length
	  of the entered magnitude vector. 

          If you're having trouble with supplied IDL routines, remember
          to use the "?" or "man,[name]" protocols to get complete
          information on how they work.

#7:  You should start by making sure you understand the derivation of
     Lec12-Eqn (1) and base your calculations on this, not the
     "limiting case" approximations given later in the lecture notes.
     As a reality check on your answers, you can refer to the plot of
     limiting magnitudes for the 40-in given in that lecture (tho the
     assumptions differ to some extent).

Please be sure your journal files & supporting materials are in
a directory named "astr511" in your home directory.  


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
11/10/03:

   The rules for reservations and use of Fan resources
   were "re-iterated" in class today.  You know what
   they are.  The only new element discussed was the 
   following:

   If you intend not to use a night for reasons other
   than bad weather, you MUST cancel your reservation
   at least 24 hours in advance...which means by 4 PM
   on the preceding date.  Otherwise, you are expected
   to make full use of the night, assuming conditions
   permit.  Please remember that social activities or
   work in other courses are not legitimate reasons
   for missing lab time. 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
11/4/03:

   Instructions for Lab 4 will be distributed
   on Wednesday, but you should start making detailed
   plans now.  You should discuss your project,
   observing, and data reduction plans with Peter
   and David ASAP.  Use the e-Calendar to sign up
   for Fan time.  Group 2 has priority for specific
   nights when transits are predicted.  Otherwise,
   groups should sign up for all nights in advance,
   after checking with Peter and David regarding
   their schedules.  You should not waste any usable
   nights until all groups have finished observations.
   
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
10/31/03:

   As a Halloween treat, the deadline for Lab 3
   is extended to Friday, Nov. 7.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
10/27/03

   To clarify the observing-time reservation system
   for Lab 3.  Groups MUST email both Peter Frinchaboy
   and Jeff Crane at the time they fill out the reservation
   form to be sure that support is available.  Peter and
   Jeff will respond.  

   On the day in question, groups should consult with Peter 
   and Jeff regarding details, meeting times, transportation,
   etc. by  mid-afternoon.  If weather is not guaranteed, 
   all parties should decide by joint consultation around
   5 PM whether and when to proceed. 

   Remember, Lab 3 can be done through partial cloud.  You
   do not need a "photometric" night for this experiment.
   P Cyg can be observed until ~ 11 PM.  Rho Cas can
   be observed all night long.  N1068 can be observed
   after about 8 PM.  If necessary, you may have to 
   split your observing between two nights. 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
10/20/03:

   To make progress on Lab 3, it's important that students
   observe on every usable night.  Consequently, 
   groups should reserve every available night according to
   their individual schedules until the Lab 3 observations
   are finished.  Friday, Saturday, Sunday nights included.
   Decide by a, say, 5 PM deadline on a given night whether
   the weather will permit observations.  

   DUE DATE:  the lab is due MONDAY NOV. 3.  (two weeks from
   today)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
10/15/03:

   Procedure for reserving Fan Mountain spectrograph
   time:  use the standard "Observatory Calendar" page
   to reserve a night.  Also send email to Peter Frinchaboy
   and Jeff Crane alerting them of your plans.

   Clear nights are scarce!  Make use of any that you can.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
10/3/03:

   Don't forget the FAN MOUNTAIN TOUR on Wed, Oct. 8.
   You'll need to arrange to share vehicles.
   David McDavid will be in charge of the tour.

   PS 3 is officially due Wed, Oct 8, but I won't
   be here to pick up the problem sets until
   Sunday 10/12.  No penalties. Please put the problem
   sets in MY MAIL BOX.  

   Don't forget the IRAF TUTORIALS, Mon & Thurs,
   Oct. 6 & 9.  

   Because of Fall Break, the Lab 2 deadline is 
   EXTENDED from Wed 10/15 to Friday 10/17.  But
   START SOON, because you may need the extra
   time.  

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
9/25/03:

   As discussed in class, the Fan Mountain 40-in spectrograph
   has achieved first light, so we will use it in Lab III.

   On Wednesday, Oct 1, class will be held at McCormick
   Observatory for a demonstration with the 26-in spectrograph.

   There will be a guest lecture on fiber spectroscopy by 
   Jeff Crane on Monday, Oct 6 and a tour of Fan Mountain
   during class time on Wednesday, Oct 8.

   The due date for Lab IV proposals is postponed until
   Wednesday, Oct 1.  

   You should plan to attend, or at least review the notes
   from, Peter Frinchaboy's tutorial on the use of IRAF,
   scheduled for noon on Monday Oct 6 with a repeat on
   Thursday Oct 9.  
   
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

9/10/03:  The standard reference to consult for technical
   information related to problem sets and labs is "Allen's 
   Astrophysical Quantities," the latest edition (2000) of 
   which is edited by Arthur Cox.  It is on reserve (general
   reserve, not just for this class)  in the Astronomy Library.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

9/8/03:  Mars is only visible above the trees at McCormick after
  midnight.  If it is not easily accessible for you, choose another
  target from the list to observe in its place.  You should observe 5
  targets total in part E of Lab 1.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
9/3/03:  Because of bad weather, the DEADLINE for LAB 1 is
           extended one week to 9/26.

         The deadline for PS-1 is extended one meeting to 
            Monday, 9/15.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
9/1/03:  Be sure to sign up for Lab-1 time soon!

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
8/27/03:  REMINDERS

     1) Special meeting 3 PM Friday 8/29 for tour of McCormick
        facilities and background on Lab 1.  Note will be
        followed at 4:30 by a brew party sponsored by Chairman
        Rood.

     2) Form 3 lab groups of 4 students each.  Pick group leaders.
	Please do your best to distribute people with observing
	experience among the groups.
