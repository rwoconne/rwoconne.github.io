<h2> I.  WHY UVOIR?  </h2>

<h3>A.  Definition</h3>

<ul>

<b>UVOIR</b> = the <b>"UV, Optical, Near-Infrared"</b> region of the EM spectrum</p>

<ul>

<li> Shortest wavelength:  912 &Aring; (91.2 nm) --- the Lyman edge of H I;
	the <b>interstellar medium</b> is opaque for hundreds of
        &Aring below this point</p>

<li> Longest wavelength:  ~3 <big>&#181;</big>
	(3000 nm) --- serious H<sub>2</sub>O absorption in <b>Earth's
	atmosphere</b> above this point.  </p>


</ul>
</ul>

<h3>B.  Uniqueness</h3>

<ul>

<li>  Best developed instrumentation; best understood  astrophysically<br>

<li>  <b>Highest density</b>  of astrophysical information <br>

<li> Most of the important features of the universe, from planets and
      stars to the interstellar medium, dark matter, and clusters of
      galaxies, were
      <a href="EM-discov1.html">first recognized</a> in the UVOIR bands.

<li> The UVOIR provides prime diagnostics on most astrophysical
      phenomena but especially on the <b>two most important physical
      tracers</b>:</p>
</ul>

<h2> II. KINDS OF UVOIR OBSERVATIONS </h2>

<ul>

<li> <b>Imaging</b>:  distribution of EM energy on the celestial sphere<br>

<li> <b>Astrometry</b> : a sub-class of imaging:  precision
		      measures of positions & motions <br>

<li> <b>Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs)</b>:  distribution of EM
energy with frequency<br>

<ul>

<li>  Photometry (low resolution)<br>

<li>  Spectroscopy (higher resolution)<br>

</ul>
			
<li>  <b>Variability</b><br>

<li>  <b>Polarimetry</b></p>

<p><br></p>

<h2> III.  PRIORITY OF OBSERVATIONS IN ASTRONOMY</h2>

 Astronomy is driven more by <b>new observational discoveries</b> than
       by fundamental interpretive insights (i.e. <b>theory</b>).  The
       development of astrophysics has been shaped by observations in
       about 3/4 of instances.</p>

<!-- add link to page listing in chronological order? no--Harwit does not
list chronlogically & his categorization of discoveries is a little
convoluted  -->

<!-- 
<ul>
 For a master list of key astronomical discoveries, with analysis, see <em>Cosmic Discovery</em>
 by Martin Harwit. </p>
</ul>

-->

Few important astronomical discoveries were predicted; many 
      were actually <b>accidental</b> </p>

Examples of accidental discoveries: (the technique/original motivation
is given in <em>parentheses</em>)</p>

<ul>

<li> Uranus (<em>visual telescopic sky-scan</em>)<br>

<li> Expansion of the universe (<em>faint galaxy spectroscopic survey</em>)<br>

<li> Pulsars (<em>radio scintillation observations</em>)<br>
 
<li> Supermassive black holes/AGN's (<em>radio surveys, optical spectroscopic surveys</em>)<br>
<ul><font size="-1">Although nuclear activity had been recognized since
the 1940's (Seyfert), its prevalence and significance was not understood until
radio observations in the 1950's-60's, especially of the compact
Quasi Stellar Objects.
</font><br></ul>

<!-- BH's a theoretical concept since 1916 (Schwarzschild
           solution to GRT eqns for spherical obj) but receiving
          little interest until 1960's.  Seemed UNTESTABLE before
          that.  Then QSO's discovered, and this revitalized study
          of BH's

           Note that the "active galaxy nuclei" AGN phenomenon was
           known since 1940's (Seyfert), recognition of importance and
           scope of phenom. needed new RADIO observations in 1950-60's
           AND identification of some of these with OPTICAL STARLIKE
           sources, leading to discovery of Quasi Stellar Objects
           (QSO's) that generated enormous amounts of energy in
           compact regions.

          Even now (1997), after 30 years of fairly intensive work on
	  BH CANDIDATES the question of their existence is still not
	  quite resolved, and rests NOT on subtleties of theoretical
	  calcuations, but instead simple estimates based on orbit
	  theory in binary stars and galaxy nuclei---i.e. the
	  theoretical part of problem goes back to Newton!

-->

<li> Large scale structure (<em>redshift surveys aimed at measuring the galaxy luminosity function</em>) <br>

<li> Dark matter in spiral galaxies: <a href="im/flatrotcurves-Rubinetal78.gif" >flat rotation curves</a>
(<em>optical/radio spectroscopy</em>)<br>

<li> X-ray emitting gas in clusters of galaxies (<em>early X-ray sky surveys</em>)<br>

<li> <a href="im/grb-1297-keck.jpg" >Gamma ray bursts</a> (<em>military satellites looking for clandestine nuclear tests</em>)<br>

<li>  Extra-solar planets (<em>optical spectroscopic monitoring</em>)<br>

<ul><font size="-1">There was a general expectation that these existed,
based on the Copernican Principle, for example.  But theoreticians
predicted that massive planets could exist only at large distances
from parent stars, implying 5-year or longer survey periods.  The
first planetary-sized bodies orbiting another star were found
accidentally by radio observations of a pulsar (Wolszczan & Frail,
1992).  More normal exoplanets were first securely identified through
optical Doppler-shift surveys of bright stars (Mayor & Queloz,
1995).</font><br> </ul>

<li> <a href="https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2012/37/3098-Image.html" >High redshift
evolution of galaxies</a>: e.g. "the Butcher-Oemler effect"; discovery of
"cosmic noon" 
(<em>deep optical imaging</em>)<br> <ul><font size="-1"> HST
contributions in this area---e.g. the Hubble Deep Field (1996)---were
actually hindered by theoretical prejudice that distant galaxies would
be too faint to detect.  The HDF deep pencil-beam survey
was delayed by 5 years.   </font><br> </ul>



<!-- In this instance, theoreticians actually INHIBITED plans to take deep
     HST images of distant galaxies; no real theoretical basis/guidance
     for predicting what should see in early universe.  Most predictions
     made 1970-95 were WRONG.  Expected formation/assembly activity
     only at much higher redshifts.   Predicted surface brightnesses
     would be too low for HST detection. 

     another example:  H_2O in the ISM  -->

<li><a href="im/accel-universe-Sci-cov-Einstein.gif">Dark energy</a>
 (<em>deep supernova surveys to study cosmic curvature</em>)</p>

</ul>

Counterexamples:  theory-driven discoveries</p>

<ul>

<li>  Neptune  (<em>Leverrier, Adams predictions from Newtonian dynamics</em>)  <br>
<li>  General relativistic distortion of space-time near Sun (<em>Eddington expedition, 1919</em>)  <br>

<li>  21 cm line of HI (<em>Van de Hulst 1944; Ewen & Purcell 1951</em>)<bf>

<li>  Helioseismology<br>

<li> Cosmic microwave background <br>

<ul> <font size="-1">Predicted in 1948 by Gamow, Alpher, & Herman.
The actual discovery by Penzias & Wilson 16 years later was
accidental, but a second team led by Dicke was preparing a deliberate
search and would have been successful.</font><br> </ul>

<li>Gravitational waves (<em>predicted 1916 by Einstein from his
general theory of relativity</em>):<br>
<ul> <font size="-1">
 Indirect detection of gravitational waves was made in a binary pulsar
 system by Hulse and Taylor (1974).  Direct detection was extraordinarily
 difficult but accomplished by LIGO in 2015.</font></p>
</ul>


</ul>

The priority of observations means that all astronomers, observers
or not, must know how to <b>interpret and critically evaluate</b>
them and must stay alert for the <b>new opportunities</b> they present.</p>

Other key technical developments:  </p>

<ul>

<li> <b>Sky surveys</b></p>

<ul> 

<li> First: Hipparchus, 130 BC.  Thousands since, many of them enabled
   by special purpose telescopes.</p>

<li> Two most important in 20<sup>th</sup> century: </p>
<ul>

<li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Draper_Catalog"
>Henry Draper Catalog [HD]</a> (all-sky, stellar spectra) ===>
stellar astrophysics. </p>

<li> <a href="im/48in-color.jpg" >Palomar 48-in Schmidt</a>
Sky Survey [POSS] & southern counterparts (all-sky, deep imaging) ===>
source for identification of all types of stars, clusters, nebulae,
and extragalactic systems.  Online version:  <a
href="http://stdatu.stsci.edu/dss/">Digitized Sky Survey</a>.</p>

</ul>

<li> Large format, 2-D array detectors, coupled with the ability to
store and manipulate huge digital data sets on computers, are driving
the current explosion in imaging/spectroscopic sky surveys (e.g. 2dF,
SDSS, PanSTARRS, 2MASS, LSST, and many others, often with cutie-pie names)</p>

</ul>

<li>  <b>Classification systems</b> (e.g. HD stellar spectral
classification, ca. 1890; Hubble galaxy classification, ca. 1920)</p>

</ul>


<p><br></p>


<h2>V.  FLUX MEASUREMENTS IN ASTRONOMY</h2>

<h3>A.  Signal-to-Noise Ratio</h3>

<ul>

<li> "Sensitivity"---i.e. the faintest source measurable---is not simply a matter
of the size of the photon collector.</p>

<li> It is instead a
<a href="im/m101simsA-3pan.gif" ><b>signal-to-noise</b></a> issue:</p>

<ul>

<li>  SNR (or "S/N") &nbsp;  = &nbsp; value measured / uncertainty in measure</p>

<li>  Depends on structure of source (point vs. extended), nature
of the luminous background & surroundings, foreground absorption, telescope &
instrument throughput, characteristics of detectors (quantum efficiency, noise)</p>

<li>  Fundamental limits are from <b>photon statistics</b>  </p>

<ul>
<img src="im/sn-lt-rootn-e.gif" align=middle>, &nbsp; where N is number of detected source photons</p>
</ul>

<!--  SNR < sqrt(N),  -->

</ul>

</ul>

<h3>B. Typical SNR's in Astronomy:</h3>

<ul>
<li>  Some things are known exactly (SNR is infinite)</p>
<ul>

<li>  The sun is a star<br>
<li>  Only one star interior to Earth's orbit<br>
<li>  No new elements are possible with fewer protons than uranium</p>

</ul>

<li>  High precision measures: e.g. length of the AU; period
of pulsars.  SNR > 10<sup>9</sup>.  </p>

<!--  cf. D'Amico et al. ApJL astro-ph/0010272.  Pulsar periods
 measured to ~1 part in 10^7-8.   -->


<li>  Measures of astronomical EM fluxes:</p>


<ul>
<li> Best precision (Kepler and TESS exoplanet transit missions): SNR
> 10000 </p>

<ul>
 <b>Modest</b>  by lab standards!  Problems: difficulty of 
instrument calibration in the "field"; faintness of interesting sources.  </p>
</ul>

<li>   Typical "good" measures:  SNR ~ 20-100</p>

<li>   Threshold detections:   SNR ~ 5-10</p>

</ul>
</ul>

<h3>C.  The Magnitude System</h3>
<ul>

 <li> "Magnitudes" are a conventional way of describing source
brightnesses in UVOIR astronomy but one which is confusing for
newcomers because of differing definitions and hence conversion to
physical energy units.  See Lectures <a href="lec2-f03.pdf" >2</a>
and <a href="lec14-f03.pdf">14</a>.</p>

<!-- MOVED section on mags to  LECTURE 2. -->

</ul>

<h3>D.  Backgrounds</h3>

<ul>

<li>Even when source fluxes are appreciable, detection can be inhibited
by luminous backgrounds, which reduce SNR.  
These become important when:</p>
</p> 

<ul>

(Background flux)<sub>resol-element</sub> &nbsp;  ~ &nbsp; (Source flux)<sub>resol-element</sub>
</p>

</ul>


<li><a href="im/sky-background-allwave-Leinert.gif" >Diffuse backgrounds</a>, examples:</p>

<ul>

<a href="im/U-K-skybrite-MK-CELT-tab.gif" >UVOIR</a>:
artificial light pollution + Earth's atmosphere + ecliptic scattered
sunlight + scattered Galactic light</p>

Far IR:  Earth's atmosphere + warm dust in the solar system and
<a href="im/DIRBE-allsky-dustmap-Schlegel98.gif"
>interstellar "cirrus"</a></p>

Radio:  Cosmic Microwave Background</p>

All:  additional background generated by telescope or instruments</p>

</ul>

<li>Discrete source backgrounds, examples:</p>

<ul>
Exclusion zone around bright stars caused by scattered light within instrument 
</p>

Source "confusion" caused by diffractive blending of multiple faint sources,
e.g. in <a href="m13-color.gif" >star clusters</a> or for faint,
distant <a href="im/faint-radgals-HDFFl-Richards98.gif" >radio galaxies</a>.</p>

</ul>

<!-- 
<li>   Background source confusion: e.g. importance of AGN's
first recognized in radio bands, since there is less source confusion at relevant levels there 
than in optical</p>

-->

</ul>
</ul>

<p><br></p>

<h2>VI.  LIMITS OF OBSERVATIONAL CAPABILITY</h2>


<h3>A.  EM Wavelength Coverage </h3>

<ul>

<li> There has been <a href="im/EMcoverage-v-date-LLM.jpg">rapid
expansion since 1950</a>, facilitated by development of many different
electronic detector technologies and space astronomy.</p>

<li>  The entire EM spectrum except for the extremes
is now accessible at some level to astronomers.</p>

</ul>

<h3>B.  Point Source Sensitivity </h3>

<ul>
 Faintest UVOIR point source detected:</p>

<ul>

<li>  Naked eye: &nbsp;  &nbsp; 5-6 mag<br>

<li>  Galileo telescope (1610):  &nbsp;  &nbsp; 8-9 mag <br>

<li>  Palomar 5-m (1948):  &nbsp;  &nbsp;21-22 mag (pg),<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;25-26 mag (CCD) <br> 

<li>   Keck 10-m (1992):  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;27-28 mag<br>

<li>  HST (2.4-m in space, 1990):  &nbsp;  &nbsp; 29-31 mag</p>


</ul>

<!-- ADD: WF3 diagram of instrumental limits? --No hold for lecture on EM spec -->

<!-- Faintest surface areas detected(?)  -->

NB: current optical detectors have ~ 100% quantum efficiency.
Therefore, we can't improve sensitivity via detector development.  In
the UV and IR there is room for detector improvement.</p>

</ul>


<h3>C.  Spatial Resolution  </h3>

<ul>

<li> The fundamental limit is governed by <b>diffraction</b> in
telescopes and instruments: the minimum image diameter is given by:</p>


<ul><ul>
<img src="im/airy-diam-e.gif" align=middle> &nbsp; radians</p>
</ul></ul>

where D is the diameter of the optics aperture </p>

<li> At 5500 &Aring;, 
<img src="im/airy-dcm-e.gif" align=middle> <br>


<li> Inside Earth's atmosphere, <b>turbulence</b>  strongly affects image diameter.</p>

<ul>

The resulting <a href="im/seeing-movie.gif" >image blur & motion</a>
is called "seeing", and typically yields:</p>

<ul>
<img src="im/thet-atm-e.gif" align=middle> 
</ul>

... i.e. spatial resolution in most instances is governed by the <b>atmosphere</b>,
not the telescope. (Much effort is now aimed at turbulence control near
telescopes.)</p>

</ul>

<li> Best UVOIR images:  HST, ~ 0.06" (~ a quarter at 90 km) </p>

<li> Ground-based (8-m) single-aperture "adaptive optics"
systems yield  0.05" over limited fields (in the near infra-red, but not for <
1 &#181;) </p>

   <!-- K band diffraction limit for 8-m, from MAXAT Workshop 98. -->

<li> Anticipated UVOIR interferometers: 0.001" </p>

<li> Best overall resolution: very long baseline radio
interferometry -- but limited to rare, high surface brightness radio
sources.  Best resolution to date (about 0.000020" at 1.3 mm
wavelength) was achieved by
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_Horizon_Telescope">Event
Horizon Telescope</a> (2019-20). </p>

</ul>


<h3>D. Spectral Resolution</h3>

<ul>

<li> The theoretical maximum resolution is governed by diffraction in
optical components, but the practical limit is set by photon rates.
High resolution devices in astronomy are typically <b>photon-starved</b> (except
for observations of the Sun).</p>

<li> Source identification, surveys, and classification are typically
done at <b>low resolution</b> (10-5000
&Aring;)</p>

<li> Physical analysis is done at <b>moderate-to-high</b>  resolution
(0.01-10 &Aring;)  </p>

<li> Highest to date:  ~ 0.001 &Aring; </p>

</ul>


<h3>E. Other Properties: e.g. polarization, variability</h3>

<ul>
Based on the new technologies supporting wide-field sky surveys for
variable or transient sources, "time domain astronomy" has become a
major specialty in the last twenty years.  Examples are
Pan-STARRS, the Zwicky Transient Facility, and (in the coming decade)
the LSST.</p>

</ul>

<ul><li> Brown dwarf companions can be 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup>
times fainter than their primary stars.  Scattered light from the
primary star inhibits searches.  For detection by direct imaging, we
require a scattered light suppression technique.  The same problem,
much worse, affects the search by direct imaging for Earthlike planets
in orbit around nearby stars.</p>

<h2>VII.  NON-EM CONVEYORS OF COSMIC INFORMATION</h2>

Most astrophysical information is derived
from the study of <b>electromagnetic waves</b> propagating over significant
distances.  However, there are several niches where important
information is, or could be, conveyed by other means.

<!-- SHIFT TO LEC 2: SHROUDED PLANET QUESTION: what would we know
about universe if atmosphere was opaque (like Venus') at optical/IR
wavelengths and hand to depend on radio observations to determine
nature of cosmic sources?  

Sun, Moon apparent from diffuse glow.

Where would science have gotten by now w/o optical astronomy?

Navigation, timekeeping, calendar keeping? 

Tho could see, e.g. HI redshifts, we wouldn't even know that H was the
predominant chemical building block of universe, since wouldn't have
spectra of stars---tho could get spectrum of Sun.  

A brief version of this point was added to the "EM Spectrum - Discovery-2"
page ca. 2003.
