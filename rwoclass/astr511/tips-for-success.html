<h1 align="center"> TIPS FOR SUCCESS IN<br> OBSERVATIONAL ASTRONOMY 
</h1>

<center><img src="im/hubble-w-m31pic.jpg" width=54% vspace=35></center>

<a name=" ">

Here are some tips for graduate students, which I think would be
echoed by most of my colleagues, on how to approach research in
observational astronomy.</p>

<h3>A.  Learn to ask the <em>right questions</em></h3>

<ul>

<li> In undergraduate school, you became good at answering questions
posed by others.  Now, you have to learn to <b>ask your own
questions</b>.  This is as important as any other aspect of
front-line research.  </p>

<li>  Learn to <b>rank</b> issues for
overall importance to the field and for novelty.</p>

<li>Here's a simple <b>thought experiment</b> you might try every
    so often to put things in perspective:</p>

<ul> Suppose you had access to a <em>"transient trans-temporal
     viewport"</em> that would allow you to read an elementary
     astronomy textbook from the year 2100 AD for one hour.  What
     topics would you look up?  </p>

</ul>
</ul>


<h3>B.  Learn to assess <em>solvability</em></h3>

<ul>

<li> Learn how to determine which questions/problems are ripe for
progress. </p>

<li> Solvability is a function both of the state of current knowledge and
existing observational capabilities.</p>

<li> Many "interesting" problems are <b>not</b> ripe for solution.</p>

<li> Evaluate <b>signal-to-noise</b> issues; these are often critical
to assessing solvability. </p>

 <li> Also assess the interests & strengths of <b>competing
groups</b> & their potential for beating you to a result.</p> </ul>


<h3>C.  Develop a healthily <em>skeptical outlook</em></h3>

<ul>

<li>  <b><em>Cultivated skepticism</em></b> is the cornerstone of science</p>

<ul>

<font color="green"><em>
"He believed in the primacy of doubt,
not as a blemish upon our ability to know<br> but as the essence of
knowing." </em></font>  <br>  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 ----- J. Gleick, writing about physicist Richard Feynman. </p>

</ul>

<li> Apply to:  established results, new results, and <b>(especially)
your own results</b></p>

<ul>

 <b>Be self-critical</b>: make "reality check" your mantra. </p>

  Find your own mistakes before somebody else does.</p>

</ul>
</ul>


<h3>D.  Know the <em>scientific background</em> thoroughly </h3>

<ul>

<li> Learn to <b>critically dissect the 
literature</b>, based on original, not secondary, sources and
to integrate it into a coherent whole. </p>

<li> For longer term projects (e.g. a thesis) it is important to learn
the <b>entire history</b> of your field.  You need to know how others
got from "C" to "D" if you're hoping to go from "J" to "K."  Among
other benefits, there are many excellent insights that remain
unexploited in the older literature.</p>

<li> It is just as important to become familiar with the <b>wrong</b>
ideas and <b>why</b> they were wrong as it is to know the currently accepted
"right" ideas.  There have been many more wrong ideas than right ones.
</p>

<!-- Consequently, most of yours will be wrong.  -->

<!-- 7/31/16: just discovered quote:  

      "What really makes science grow is new ideas, including false
      ideas."  Sir Karl Popper (1902-1994)     -->


<li>Beware of the "emperor's new clothes."  Always bring fresh eyes
to any subject.</p>

<li>
Read the more important papers from hardcopy.  <b>Annotate them or make
written summaries</b> of key findings, strengths & weaknesses.  It helps
to keep copies of related papers together in a binder. </p>

<ul>
<em>NB</em>: my preference for hardcopy is only partly because of old
    age.  My definite impression is that using only screens leads to
    poorer comprehension and less careful writing (and thinking).
    Controlled studies have also shown that taking handwritten rather
    than digital notes conveys better understanding.  This phenomenon
    is not well understood, but it appears to be real.</p>

    Nonetheless, assistance in organizing digital copies of the more
    important literature is ever more valuable as the volume of
    published material continues to exponentiate (doubling time about
    9 years).  Using a reference management system like Mendeley is
    highly recommended for young scientists, though you can easily set
    up a <a href="rwo-lit-lib-example-aug21.txt">simple literature
    library</a> for yourself.</p>

   
</ul>

<li> In this area, your <b>memory</b> is one of your greatest personal
assets.  The ability to absorb, organize, correlate, synthesize, and
recall large amounts of information is essential to a working
scientist.  Your K-12 teachers should have spent more time on that.
Any fool can "look it up on the Internet." </p>

</ul>

<h3>E. Develop skill with <em>ROMPs & SWAGs</em> </h3>

<ul>

<li> ROMPs & SWAGs = "rough order of magnitude problems" and "silly wild-ass                 
guesses"</p>

<li> Simple exploratory calculations are the <b>best way</b> to shape the
early stages of any research program.</p>

<li> The first
three <a href="https://rwoconne.github.io/rwoclass/astr511/psindex.html">ASTR
511 problem sets</a> contain good examples of ROMPs in basic
observational astronomy.</p>

<li> For an extended treatment, see, for example, S. Mahajan's MIT
course on
<a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-098-street-fighting-mathematics-january-iap-2008/">Street
Fighting Mathematics</a>.</p>

</ul>



<h3>F.  Track your own <em>progress</em></h3>

<ul>
<li> Set <b>milestones</b> and regularly <b>review</b> your progress
towards them.  Are you converging towards your goals? </p>

<li> Keep a <b>regular journal</b> of your ideas (good
& bad).  If you're engaged with your subject, there should
be entries almost every day.  </p>

<ul>

<li> You will find it essential to also keep detailed <b>logs/journals</b>
concerning individual research projects.  That includes tracking
software development and journaling interactive computing sessions.</p> 

</ul>
</ul>

<h3>G. Take quick advantage of <em>new observational capabilities</em></h3>

<ul>
<li> These are often the source of important new discoveries.</p>

<li> A "new capability" can be as simple as large amounts of observing
time on an existing facility or a small upgrade such as a new type
of imaging filter or a higher dispersion grating in a spectrometer.
</p> 

<li> You need a running start (and an informed assessment of the
competitive climate) to take advantage of early science in big new
projects like JWST or LSST.</p>

</ul>

<h3>H. Learn to write good <em>observing proposals</em></h3>

<ul>

<li> Success rates for proposals on important facilities are small:
typically in the range 10-40%.</p>

<li> A compelling proposal must be clearly, persuasively, and concisely
written and must demonstrate:</p>

<ol>

  <li> That the questions you are asking are <b>important and interesting</b>; <br>
  <li> That the program is <b>technically feasible</b>;
  <li> That you are <b>competent</b> to execute it; and <br>
  <li> That it will provide a <b>definitive answer</b> to the questions posed.</p>

</ol>

<li> You must write for harried, non-specialist TAC members who
usually have only a <b>few minutes</b> to read each proposal and who
are looking for <b>reasons to reject</b></p>

<li> For details on planning and writing proposals in this 
competitive environment, see my
<a href=" https://rwoconne.github.io/rwoclass/astr8500/writing-proposals-RWO-A8500.html">
"Tips on Writing Proposals in Astronomy"</a>.</p>

<li> <b>Practice</b> writing proposals in conjunction with your
advisors before you leave the shelter of graduate school.</p>


</ul>



<h3>I. Understand your <em>instruments</em>  well </h3>

<ul>

<li> This will take a minimum of 2-3 observing runs with a given
instrument.</p>

<li> Learn their limits and how to push the envelope.</p>
</ul>

<h3>J. Understand <em>analysis techniques</em>  well </h3>

<ul>
<li> It is doubtful that your early reductions/analysis for a given problem will be 
acceptable in the long run.  Plan for <b>iterations</b>, possibly extensive. </p>

<li> <b>Test</b> techniques on synthetic data sets where you know the answer.</p>

<li> You will need to develop a good working familiarity
 with <b>statistical methods</b> of analyzing observations and
 hypothesis testing.  </p>

</ul>

<h3>K. Dealing with <em>computers</em></h3>

<ul>

<li> Computers are <b>tools, not science</b>.</p>

<!-- Heed the warning in:

 "Men have become the tools of their tools."
       --- Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862)
-->

<li> Despite appearances, computers have <b>not</b>  increased
the capacity of the human brain to absorb and process information. 
You will have to work hard to distill and clarify what computers
are telling you.</p>

<li>  Don't trust and <b>always verify</b>.  You can't really do this
unless you understand clearly how computers work, and this
means that...  </p>

<ul>

You will almost certainly have to become a capable computer
<b>programmer</b>, not merely a user of pre-packaged software.  It's
useful to know how to code in more than one language, assuming
the need arises naturally out of the science.</p>

The advent of petabyte-scale data-driven astronomy in the 2020's
makes coding experience yet more valuable.</p>

</ul>

<!-- <li>  If it's important, read it from <b>paper</b> </p> -->

<li> Grad school in astronomy provides excellent exposure to
sophisticated applications programming and large data sets.  If this
becomes your main interest and you decide on a career outside of
academic science that emphasizes computing, your best approach is to
obtain your astronomy degrees as quickly as possible, learning more
about computing in your spare time, and then focus all your energies
on the new field.</p>

<li> Social media?  For pre-professionals, involvement with social
media should be cautious.  It can become an unproductive time-sink,
and the visibility and permanence of unfiltered thoughts have
cratered many a career.  <b>Beware.</b></p>


</ul>

<h3>L.  Dealing with <em>advisors</em></h3>

<ul> 

<li> Most advice comes from long experience; <b>don't
disregard it lightly</b>.  In troublesome areas, seek advice from several
senior people. </p>

<li> Look at any research project or task assigned you, no matter how
outwardly routine, as an <b>opportunity</b> to grow as a scientist beyond the
nominal boundaries.  You may well have new insights or see new avenues
to exploit that your overloaded advisor has missed or ignored.  </p/>

<li> In the course of a PhD project, you are expected to become
<b>independent</b> of your advisor and at least as knowledgeable
as s/he is on that subject.  You should know what is the <b>"next
step"</b> before being told. </p>

</ul>

<h3>M.  Dealing with <em>groups</em></h3>

<ul> A glance at the ApJ will demonstrate the growing <b>dominance of
group science</b>.  The rise of groups is a natural consequence of the
increasing scope and complexity of modern astronomical research.  New
instruments are almost always shepherded by groups.  Group work is
also an increasingly important mechanism for marshalling diverse
existing resources to do large-scale science (e.g. the supernova
surveys, the deep fields, SDSS, etc).  </p>

Being a member of a large group provides a rapid education in how
professional astronomy is conducted and also cushions your initiation
because substantial resources and expertise are there to help you.  On
the other hand, you have to work harder to establish a perspective and
reputation independent of the group. </p>

Successful professional groups are based on <b>complementary
strengths, not mutual weaknesses</b> (unlike the group learning that
is now fashionable in educational circles).  Therefore: </p>

<ul>

<li> Develop a unique expertise, skill</p>

<li> Produce; be responsible</p>

<li> Think for yourself...but learn how to interact with other members
cordially and constructively</p>

<li> Lead by example</p>

<li> Be sure you develop a reputation/expertise that <b>distinguishes</b>
you from other group members.   In practice that implies, at a minimum,
being lead author on some of the group's publications.</p>

</ul>


Consult the history of "big physics" (accelerators, etc) for group
sociology.  For instance, large groups breed institutional imperatives
for publicizing results, which is why the media often mistake
incremental results for fundamental ones.  </p>

<!--  Apply skepticism liberally.  -->

</ul>
</ul>

<h3>N.  <em>Publishing</em></h3>

<ul> 

<li> A good goal by PhD time is to have published in the major
journals <b>one paper for every year you've been in graduate
school</b>.   You should be lead author of some of these.</p>

<li> <b>Learn to write good, clear, concise scientific prose</b>.  Most entering
graduate students <b>cannot</b> do this. </p>

<ul>

<li> Consult style guides for tips, e.g.
the <a href="Guide_to_Science_Writing.pdf"><em>Guide to Science
Writing</em></a> from the Journal of Young Investigators
and <em>The Elements of Style</em> by Strunk & White. </p>

<li> The more practice, the better.  Write up for yourself brief
reviews of the literature or summaries of your interim results in full
journal style.  These serve as good writing practice, as drafts for
polished versions or presentations, and to place your accomplishments
in the context of the main issues you are trying to address.  Ask
other students to read and critique your work. </p>

<li> Learn to write well <b>before you begin to submit work to
your advisors</b>.  You want them spending time on your ideas, not
grammar, spelling, or word usage.</p>

</ul>

<li> Be aware of the <b>``reader pyramid''</b>: few people will read the
whole paper; more will read the introduction and conclusion; many more
will skim/read the abstract.  </p>

<ul>

<li> Therefore, be sure the abstract contains all the key points, and
be sure the intro/conclusion are clear and complete. The conclusion
should emphasize what is <b>new or unique</b> about the work.</p>

</ul>

<li> Set high standards for yourself (and your co-authors) in
writing.  Reputations are based on the number of <b>good</b> papers one produces,
not the total number of papers.</p>

</ul>

<h3>O. <em>Presentations</em></h3>

<ul>

<li> Learn to give interesting and effective presentations on all
time scales from 5 minutes to an hour.  Analyze and emulate others who do
this well.</p>  

<li> <b>Real-time rehearsals are the only way</b> to prepare well
for your early ventures in this arena.  </p>

<ul>
Your rehearsals should include <b>formulating answers</b> to all the likely
questions, especially skeptical ones, from your audience. Try to view
your presentation as an outsider would. </p>
</ul>

<li> Unfortunately, you will need to learn PowerPoint or the
equivalent.  Just bear in mind that PowerPoint is the messenger, not
the message.  </p>

</ul>

<h3>P. <em>Teaching</em></h3>

<ul>

<li> The best way to understand a subject is to try to <b>teach it</b>
to somebody else.  Volunteer to give research talks, tutorials,
paper reviews, etc., to your colleagues. </p>

<li> Universities now expect viable job candidates to have some
experience with teaching, preferably undergraduate and in the form of
complete responsibility for development and delivery of at least one
course.  At UVa your best opportunity for that is to teach in the
summer session.  Teaching experience is valuable for a professional
career whether or not you are aiming for a job in higher
education. </p>

<li> Take any teaching assignment whether as TA or instructor seriously
and plan to do a good job.   Among other things, that means learning
how to handle <b>two disparate responsibilities</b> (teaching and studying/research)
simultaneously.</p>

<li> If you are interested in what awaits you in teaching large
undergraduate courses, see
my <a href="../astr8500/oconnell-Facts-lecture-feb23.pdf">lecture</a>
or
<a href="oconnell-Facts-published-2007.pdf">
article</a> on <em>Facts of Life for New Teachers in the Astronomy
Non-Majors Curriculum</em>.</p>


<li> <b>Mentoring</b> younger people is, of course, an important part
of any professional career.  Whether or not you choose to participate
as a mentor during graduate school, you should take advantage of
whatever formal training or informal advice you can find.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Q.  <em>Outreach</em></h3>

<ul>

<li> Outreach to the general public has always been embraced at some
level by most astronomical institutions (in distinction to most other
sciences).  It has lately assumed greater importance, such that
applicants for academic jobs are expected to have <b>some experience
or interest</b> here.</p>

<li> Outreach can take many forms: telescope viewing is most common;
but also observatory tours, public lectures, astronomy clubs, K-12
tutorials and activities, K-12 teacher training, planetarium and
museum displays, press liaisons and spokespersons, and so forth. Online
versions include course webpages, information sites, blogs, videos,
and podcasts, among others.  You have many options, but it is best to
choose areas where there is good departmental experience and
support.  Your outreach activities will have to be fitted around
your principal academic responsibilities.  </p>

</ul>

<h3>R.  <em>Scientific Discovery, Scientific Careers</em> </h3>

<ul>

The list of tips above constitutes tactics; but what
about <b>strategy</b>?  What is the best path to scientific discovery
or a good scientific career?
 </p>

<font color="blue"><b>Discovery</b></font> first.  </p>

<ul>
Broadly, there are two kinds of discovery: recognition of something
new or a definitive interpretation of known phenomena.  The former is
easier for young people.  For the latter, you usually need greater
exposure to the field.  Although many "interpretational" discoveries
are theoretical, others are observational (e.g. Hubble's discovery of
Cepheid variables in M31, which instantly resolved the "island
universe" controversy; or the identification of gamma-ray bursts with
distant galaxies).</p>

Scientific discoveries emerge from some combination of "the prepared
mind," resources, opportunity, and, inevitably, luck.  There is
probably about equal weight to those four components, and there's no
way to successfully engineer them.  But follow the chain in order.
The better prepared you are---the more you know and have produced---the
more likely it is that the good resources you seek will be available
to you.  Opportunity may follow.  You have to wait for luck.  Whatever
form that takes, it's essential that you be able to recognize a
favorable coincidence of opportunity and luck, which means that you must
actively cultivate an <b>alertness</b> for them. </p>

Discovery and innovation are rarely associated with very young
scientists.  All the low-hanging fruit was harvested long ago.  You
have a foundational mountain to climb before you can approach new
territory.  In pop-psychology this is sometimes referred to as the
"10,000 hours" standard: it probably takes 10,000 hours of close
engagement with the field to become ready for real
contributions.  <b>You can't "think out of the box" until you know
what's inside it.</b> </p>

You obviously can't discover something if you aren't looking, so discovery
depends also on <b>effort and persistence</b>.  Noticing something
that is unexpected is often an entree to discovery, but this means you
must know what is expected.</p>

</ul>

<font color="blue"><b>Careers?</b></font>  You need a <b>plan</b>, and you
need to think actively about it.  Your plan should build on your
interests and inclinations, but it must be shaped by the <b>realities</b>,
economic and otherwise, of the field.  You will require a number of
<b>skills</b> which you have only in embryonic form now, and part of your
plan must be to act deliberately to develop them further.</p>

<ul>

Brainpower in professional astronomy counts --- but less than it did
in your undergraduate career because (almost) everybody in the field
is bright and capable.  Instead, <b>self-motivation, hard
work, persistence, focus, efficiency, and good time-management are
critical to success</b>.</p>

Training in most graduate programs is <b>"T-shaped"</b>.  You are
expected to become acquainted with the basics of many subfields of
astronomy (the crossbar) while acquiring deep knowledge in at least
one (the upright).  The whole "T" is important.  The narrow/deep
component is essential to understanding how scientific research
actually progresses.  But from a career standpoint, you must also
develop a broad understanding of the field and versatile skills that
are transferable to other research areas.</p>

Your immediate aim by PhD time should be to become one of the
<b>leading authorities</b> on some area of significant current
interest.  It is expected that this area will usually be of modest
scope, but when conference organizers are picking the most
knowledgeable younger speakers for review talks, you want your name to
be on the short list.</p>

This means that you must not only have
important expertise but that <b>others must know you have it</b>.  The
more you talk science with your graduate student colleagues, local
scientists, and outsiders, the better.  The more you publish, the
better.  Attend topic-oriented meetings as well as the large annual
AAS meetings and <b>make as many contacts</b> as practicable. 
Keep in mind that the future leaders of the field are your
contemporaries.</p>

<ul>

It's useful to have a <b>very brief memorized summary</b> -- perhaps
30 seconds -- of your current interests (an "elevator pitch") at your
disposal whenever you will encounter people you might want to
impress.</p>

</ul>

You will make many <b>mistakes</b> during graduate school.  But everybody
does.  Good scientists learn from their mistakes and disappointments
and incorporate them into a renewed attack on the
issue.  <b>Resilience</b> is an essential attribute of successful
scientists.</p>

Research topics?  Paradoxically, it is not necessarily best to get
into the currently "hot" subject areas.  Those may be where the money
is and where your mentors are; but these areas tend to overproduce
PhDs, and there will be tough competition from experienced scientists.
Ideally, you want to be at the leading edge of a <b>new</b> wave of
research that peaks about <b>ten years from now</b>.  But, obviously,
it's not easy to figure out what that might be.  Some "hot" areas will
persist, but others won't.  Seek advice on prospects for the next
decade before deciding on your primary research program.</p>

No matter how promising
the field you choose to work in, <b>keep developing those transferable
skills and interests; keep looking around the corner</b>. </p>
