<h2>I.  INTRODUCTION</h2>

Everyone knows that the science that can be done at a given time is
circumscribed by the available resources.  In astronomy, we often
regard <u>telescopes</u> as the essential infrastructure.</p>

But data taking and analysis resources are just as important, often
more so, in determining what we can do. The development of astronomy
over the last 50 years has been shaped by the capabilities of
computers to a much larger extent than is often recognized.</p>

<u>Recent evolution</u>:</p>

<ul> Dramatic improvements in computer hardware and software 
have made it possible to manipulate very large amounts of data rapidly
and efficiently.  However, the critical qualitative change in the
conduct of astronomy has come about through access to powerful
<u>interactive computation and display</u>, which permits
understanding of numerical data in ways that were possible only for
analytic functions 20 years ago. </p>

<u>Choices</u>?
<ul>

If you become an observational astronomer, you have
essentially <u>no choice</u> but to become familiar with IRAF/STSDAS (UVOIR),
AIPS (radio), CIAO (X-ray), etc. because these provide the primary
standardized data reduction procedures.  The main decision, therefore,
is what <u>other</u> systems are most profitable to learn.  </p>
</ul>

<p><br></p>

<h2>IV.  IDL </h2>

The "Interactive Data Language" is distributed by <a
href="http://www.rsinc.com/idl/index.asp" target=show>Research
Systems, Inc.</a></p>

Unique status as a fully interactive, high-level language with a large
library of astronomer-written utilities.  </p>

Nearest thing to a <u>"universal" astronomical data system</u>
because:

<ol>

<li> It is currently <u>used across the entire EM spectrum from gamma
ray to radio wavelengths</u>.  This is unlike most other astronomical
software, which is usually confined to one wavelength regime.</p>

<li> It potentially duplicates the functionality of almost any other
astronomical software, from simple arithmetic computations and
graphics to full-blown GUI-based data analysis packages.</p>

<ul> Don't be misled: the capability is there, but <u>you</u> may have
put in the effort to make it work, depending on the application.</p>
</ul>

</ol>

Places to look for a quick introduction:</p>

<ul>
For introduction and 
applications to astronomical image processing, see the <a
href="http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/rwoclass/astr511/IDLresources/IDLguide.html"
target=show>Guide to IDL for Astronomers</a></p>

<a href="http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/contents.html"
target=show>Sample list of library software</a></p>

</ul>

Key advantages over Fortran, C, etc:</p>

<ul>
Fully interactive with embedded graphics and I/O device drivers<br>
Dynamic memory allocation<br>
Accelerated computation on arrays<br>
Large number of built-in interactive functions & utilities<br>
Large body of public, easily-implemented astronomical utilities<br>
Writing code with interactive programming/iteration greatly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  enhances efficiency & reliability<br>
Pre-compilation not required</p>
</ul>

Key advantages over MATLAB, etc:</p>

<ul>
Full high-level programming features<br>
Oriented toward image processing<br>
Large suite of astronomical-oriented utilities (e.g. FITS file I/O,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coordinate systems, astrometry, databasing, etc)</p>
</ul>

Key advantages over IRAF, etc:</p>

<ul>
Full high-level programming features; not simply a package of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  pre-defined, specialized programs<br>
Intended for user customization, adaptation, extension<br>
Active data stored in RAM, not as files<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (minimizes use of cumbersome file names and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; greatly facilitates computations)<br>
Greater versatility, transparency, and user control<br>
Journaling, command recall/edit, & other convenience features<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for increased efficiency<br>
Source code for applications routines available and modifiable on demand<br>
Writing code with interactive programming/iteration greatly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  enhances efficiency & reliability<br>
Pre-compilation not required<br>
</ul>

Key disadvantages:<//p>

<ul>
IDL is an <u>interpreted</u> rather than <u>compiled</u> language:<br>
<ul>
Compiled languages execute more rapidly and use memory more efficiently.
The differences will be invisible for most computations up to moderate
scale.  But for large-scale computing, Fortran and C are a better choice.<br>
</ul>
No equation-solving capability (use Mathematica/Maple there). </p> 
</ul>

<p><br></p>


<h2>V. THE ROLE OF IDL</h2>

<ul>

<li>  Data <u>analysis</u> and <u>visualization</u> (as opposed to reduction)</p>

<ul>

<li>IDL is <u>not</u> a recommended alternative for routine data reduction
tasks (e.g. for CCD mosaics) where IRAF, AIPS, etc., offer powerful,
reliable, and convenient packages.  These have gone through many
iterations, and most user needs have been accommodated. </p>

<li>But the multitude of specialized analysis procedures needed
following data reduction requires versatility, extended capabilities,
and customization not offered by standard packages.  IDL is
optimized for this role.</p>

</ul>

<li> Bridging gaps in standard packages</p>

<ul>
<li>IDL is now being used to convert and analyze NRAO GBT data
in ways not possible with AIPS++</p>

<li>Convenience of IDL interface now recognized in effort to develop
Python-based "PYRAF" in order to make IRAF "more like IDL"</p>

</ul>

<li> Any moderate-scale computation requiring file manipulation or
generation of numerical tables, graphics displays, or images</p>

<ul>

<li> There might be dozens of such applications arising in a single
project that would be more cumbersome to program in a compiled
or scripting language, especially if graphics is required</p>

<!--  FORTRAN, C, PERL, etc.  -->

<li> Like a "super hand-calculator," IDL is instantly available for a
wide range of such applications </p>


</ul>


<li> Enhancing scientist efficiency</p>

<ul>

The main concern of working scientists in approaching software should
be how much of <u>their own time</u> elapses before they get a given
result.  Speed of execution is secondary, whereas the speed of
coding/configuring and testing software is primary.</p>

Although we tend to think of computers in the context of large-scale
"pipeline" computations and applications which are CPU/memory-bounded,
these are really specialties.  Less than 10% of the overall computing
effort in astronomy (measured in person-hours) involves such
problems.</p>

Instead, the software effort of most astronomers is devoted to
moderate-scale computations, interactive data inspection and
evaluation, special cases not supported by large applications
packages, production of graphics for publications, and so forth.</p>

This environment places a premium on software <u>convenience,
transparency, modularity, portability, and versatility</u>---exactly
where IDL excels.  </p>

The intrinsic capabilities of IDL coupled with its interactive
environment and extensive user code libraries greatly enhance scientist
efficiency.  A given result can be reached using IDL in a small
fraction of the time it would take to do the equivalent programming in
other high level languages.</p>

<!--  FORTRAN or C or by trying to work around deficiencies in IRAF, MATLAB,
etc.  -->

IDL supplants graphics-display software such as SuperMongo or PGPLOT.
It duplicates much, though not all, of the mathematical functionality
of MATLAB, Maple, and Mathematica.  It can do much of what can be
done with PERL.  Finally, it duplicates all the functionality of
Fortran or C and is to be preferred unless the speed of computation is
<u>really</u> important. </p>

<h2>VII. GENERAL TIPS FOR DEALING WITH COMPUTERS</h2>

<ul>

<li> Computers are tools, <u>not science</u> <br>

<li> Despite appearances, computers have <u>not</u> increased the
capacity of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; human brain to absorb and
process information<br>

<li>  Don't trust and <u>always verify</u> <br>

<li>  If it's important, read it from <u>paper</u> </p>

<ul>
[I have yet to meet anyone who can proof-read
accurately<br> from a computer screen.  I am not sure why this is,<br> but
it is not a comforting observation.]</p>
