<h2>I.  INTRODUCTION </h2>

The human imagination has never been a match for the universe.  That
is why astronomy, more than any other science, has been regularly
revolutionized by <b>new observational discoveries</b>.  Since 1610, these
have depended on telescopes.  When telescope technology developed
slowly, as in the early 19th century, progress was slow.  When
technology surged, as in the late 20th century, progress was
explosive.     </p>

This page surveys the principal UVOIR telescopes available in this
decade together with a review of the milestones of the last 100
years.  A hallmark of the major telescopes in this era is the
remarkable variety of clever innovations, many of which have even more
distant historical roots.  There is very little in current telescope
design that was not thought of long ago, though converting good ideas
into realizable technologies is a different matter.</p>

A key historical lesson is that to build an instrument at the frontier
of performance is <b>always costly in terms of brains and money</b>.
Thus, progress has coupled new technology, visionary astronomical
pioneers, and the generosity of wealthy private donors or the
financial strength of governments.</p>

Note: we will not discuss <b>telescope optics</b> except briefly in
this course  (see <a href="lec16-teloptics-f03.html">this page</a>.)
That topic and the detailed properties of detectors and instruments

<h2>II.  AMERICAN OBSERVATORIES 1880-1970</h2>


<h3>A. BACKGROUND</h3>


Optical and mechanical technology in the last few decades of the 19th
century had advanced to the point that the construction of large
telescopes was feasible.  Success with large telescopes demands that
a large set of disparate requirements be met simultaneously:  quality glass for
optical elements, high precision shaping/polishing of optical surfaces,
precision mechanical support systems, excellent control systems,
excellent instrumentation, and good observing sites.  Any such project
is a major engineering undertaking.</p>

Most of the large telescopes through 1960 were associated with
universities. They were costly and required substantial private
donations.  Because of an abundance of industrial expertise, excellent
observing sites, and wealthy contributors, the US became the world's
leader in building large telescopes.  </p>


<b>Refractors vs Reflectors:</b></p>

<table border=0 width=80% align="center">

<tr><td>
<font size="3">

The large telescopes of the late 1800's were mainly <b>refractors</b>.  These were
simple optically and featured good stability for astrometry, for
instance.   Through the mid-1800's, most <b>reflectors</b> had used metal
mirrors and were of generally poor optical quality.  However, the invention
of high reflectivity thin metallic coatings for glass (initially silver)
around 1850 made possible the use of <b>glass mirrors</b>.  These were immediately
competitive with refractors in terms of quality.</p>

This, together with a host of other reasons dictated that instruments
larger than the Yerkes 40-in refractor were all reflectors:</p>


<ol>
<li> Lenses (even achromats)
produce chromatic aberration, limiting the bandwidth usable for
imaging & spectroscopy.

<li> Lenses must be figured on two sides (per
element), whereas mirrors need be figured only on one. 

<li>Mirrors are
easy to support accurately from behind, whereas lenses require support
at their edges and will sag; it is harder to support heavy lenses
mechanically at the top end of a telescope tube than a mirror at
bottom end.  

<li> The beam-folding action of primary and secondary mirrors means
that reflector tubes are much shorter than in a "straight through"
refracting design, easing mechanical design and reducing dome size.
</ol>

</p>

standard reflector telescope designs</a></p>

<b>Optical Figuring Tolerance:</b></p>

<table border=0 width=80% align="center">

<tr><td>
<font size="3">

To maintain a good image, a single reflecting surface must be figured
to within <b>1/4 wavelength</b> of its intended design.  For optical
telescopes, this is 10<sup>-5</sup> cm---very demanding.  Good
polishing/test techniques capable of reaching this precision were not
developed until the late 19th century.  When there are several
reflecting surfaces, the tolerances must be tighter.  Specifications
for state-of-the-art telescopes are for 1/10-1/20 wave optics.  The
most precise large mirror yet made was the HST 2.4-m, which was
figured to about 1/50 wave (of its test wavelength of 6328
&Aring;). </p>

Scale comparison:  if a 320-in (8-m) diameter telescope mirror were
scaled up to the size of the <b>continental United States</b>, i.e. about
3000 miles diameter, then the maximum size of a ripple allowed in its
polishing would be less than <b>2 inches</b>!  [You should be asking yourself
how it is possible to determine the figure of a large mirror to that
precision without the use of very expensive metrology equipment.]  </p>

<ul>

<li> 

At the urging of <a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2009/jan/30-the-father-of-dark-matter-still-gets-no-respect">Fritz Zwicky</a>, 
among others, Caltech commissioned
the <a href="im/48in-color.jpg" >48-in Schmidt telescope</a> as a
wide-field survey instrument to support the 200-in.  Based on
the <a href="im/48-in-schmidt-Porter-draw.jpg" >design</a> of Bernhard
Schmidt this <b><em>catadioptric</em></b> telescope uses a spherical mirror
together with a thin refractive corrector lens to eliminate spherical
aberration over a wide field of view (6<sup>o</sup> diameter in this
case).  The 14-in square focal plane is inside the body of the
telescope; it is convex and required that photographic plates be
curved under pressure to match.  The 48-in Schmidt made the multiband
photographic "POSS" surveys and today, with the substitution of a
large-format CCD mosaic camera, is undertaking the
<a href="http://www.ptf.caltech.edu/ztf">Zwicky Transient
Survey</a>. </p>


<li> In the 1970's, NOAO developed a <a href="im/kpno-4m-med.jpg"
>4-m telescope design</a> based on the 200-in, and
this has been reproduced, more or less closely, in multiple versions,
sizes 3.5-4.2m, around the world (e.g. KPNO 4-m, CTIO 4-m, AAT,
CFHT).  </p>

<h2>III. NEW TECHNOLOGIES 1970-2020</h2>

Telescope technologies steadily improved throughout the first half of
the 20th century, with much progress in mechanical design (e.g. the
oil pressure bearing of the 200-in), structural materials, optical
figuring, electrical control systems (e.g. analog computers), and
astronomical instruments to attach to telescopes.  However, until
about 1975, big telescope design was still based largely on the
concepts used for the Mt. Wilson and Palomar reflectors (designed
1900-30).  Unfortunately, the cost of extending such designs to sizes
larger than 200-in was prohibitive.  For a given design, <b>cost scales
roughly as the mass</b> of the telescope or the <b>cube</b> of the
diameter.</p>

<!-- ----Cite Volumes/Conferences on new technologies</p> -->

In the early 1980's a series of innovations was introduced that made
yet larger telescopes affordable, mainly by <b>reducing the total
weight, including the dome</b>, per unit optical collecting area.
These included:</p>

Various combinations of these innovations were first incorporated in a
number of 4-m class telescopes (e.g. ESO NTT, WIYN, ARC), but their
main impact was on 6-m and larger telescopes.</p>

Important related issues:</p>


<table border=0 width=80% align="center">
<tr><td>
<font size="3">

<b>Site selection</b> was recognized as critical.  For best
transparency at infrared wavelengths, high, dry sites, over 8,000
ft, became preferred.   The summit of <a href="im/MK-summit-aerial.jpg"
>Mauna Kea</a>, on the big island of Hawaii, is at 13,800 feet and 
is the premier telescope site in the northern hemisphere.
Needless to say, good telescope sites must be as distant as possible
from sources of 
<a href="im/world-map-light-pollution-v2-16.jpg">
artificial light pollution</a>, a growing worldwide
problem.
</p>

The <b>financing</b> yo-yo:</p>

<!-- of major projects underwent several changes.  -->

<ul>

After 1950, public funding from NSF had almost completely replaced the
private financing responsible for the large telescopes prior to World
War II.  But NSF's budget failed to keep pace with the rapidly
increasing number of astronomers and the expanding observational
opportunities enabled by the new technologies.  By 1985, US
astronomers began turning again to private benefactors to finance
large ground-based telescopes.  </p>

<!--  (e.g. <a href="http://celt.ucolick.org/" >CELT</a>)
-->

The twin Keck 10-m telescopes were supported by a private gift of $120
million to Caltech, with a comparable contribution of state funds in
the form of operating costs from the University of California.  Other
large facilities with a significant private component include the
Magellan telescopes, the MMT, and the LBT.  By contrast, the European
VLT was financed with public funds (about $800 million) secured
through international treaties by the European Southern Observatory.
Because of the rapidly escalating costs, US planning for the next
generation of telescopes in the 20-50 meter class
(e.g. <a href="http://www.tmt.org/">TMT</a>, <a href="https://www.gmto.org">GMT</a>)
is based on public/private partnerships. </p>

<h2>IV.  STATE OF THE ART TELESCOPES</h2>

As of 2018, there were 16 ground-based telescopes operating with
diameters of 6.5-m or larger.  A list with links is available
<a href="http://astro.nineplanets.org/bigeyes.html">here</a>, and a
nice graphical comparison of the collecting areas of large telescopes
through 2025 is shown <a href="im/large-telescope-areas-to-2026.png">
here</a>.</p>


<ul>

> Very Large Telescope</a>: four 8.2-m telescopes on a very
dry <a href="im/vlt-site.jpg" >site in northern Chile</a>, now has the
largest total collecting area in the world (211 square meters),
although the telescopes are normally operated separately.  The
monolithic primary mirrors are spin-cast Schott Zerodur (very low CTE)
in a meniscus shape (46:1 aspect ratio).  Shape is actively controlled
with 150 actuators.  The four telescopes can be combined to operate as
an interferometer and have well developed adaptive optics (AO)
systems. </p>

<li>  <a

<ul>

Twin 10-m diameter telescopes based on a
<a href="im/keck-diagram.jpg">segmented primary design</a> (picture at
right).  Each contains 36 stress-polished and cut 36-in hexagonal mirror
segments, with a total collecting area of 76 square meters and
a focal ratio of 1.75.  The optical system is a Ritchey-Chretien
design. </p>

The Keck mirror figure control system is a remarkable technical
achievement, although image quality is not quite as good as for a
monolithic mirror.  With its AO system, Keck can deliver <a
href="im/KeckI-firstAOim.jpg" >a resolution of 0.05 arcsec</a> at
IR wavelengths.  (Ground-based seeing becomes worse
at shorter wavelengths, and AO systems do not work well at
wavelengths below 1 &#181; or over fields larger than ~30 arcsec.)
Principal foci: Naysmith, Cassegrain.  Interferometric combination of
beams from the two telescopes was implemented until 2012.  </p> 

</ul>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Telescopio_Canarias">Gran
Telescopio Canarias</a>, on La Palma island, is operated by a consortium

Telescope</a></p>

<ul> First proposed
by <a href="spitzer-astron-advan-space-obs-1946-1990.pdf"> Lyman
Spitzer</a> in 1946 but launched in 1990.  HST orbits at 300 mi altitude,
where the deleterious effects of the Earth's atmosphere (seeing,
absorption, light emission and scattering) are eliminated.  Serviced 5
times by Space Shuttle crews (HST is the only scientific satellite
capable of human servicing).  Instrument and spacecraft upgrades were
essential for its long lifetime (30 years to date) and outstanding
performance.
</p>

HST has a small (2.4-m) but very high precision mirror in a
conventional Ritchey-Chretien Cassegrain configuration.  The primary
mirror shape was inaccurate, however, owing to miscalibrated testing
tools, with an edge about 2 &#181; too low.  This produced large
<a href="http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/rwoclass/astr511/im/spherical-aberration-paraxial.gif">spherical
aberration</a> (a 38 mm difference in focal length between the inner
and outer mirror areas).  That was correctable, however, with small
additional optical elements in each instrument.  The first servicing
mission in 1993 carried correcting optics, and HST achieved its design
goals thereafter. </p>

<!-- Add link to before/after images -->

HST carries up to 6 instruments (imagers, spectrographs, interferometers)
covering the band 1100-22500 &Aring;.  Owing to its outstanding
instrumental stability, optical precision, excellent pointing, and the
absence of atmospheric blurring, HST has produced the

highest

<h2>VI. THE NEXT GENERATION</h2>


<a href="im/GMT-artists-3.jpg"><img src="im/GMT-artists-3-ex.jpg"

Two very large telescopes based on the segmented-mirror concept
of Keck have been designed:  
the <a href="http://www.tmt.org/">
Thirty Meter Telescope</a>
 and the
<a href="http://www.eso.org/public/usa/teles-instr/elt/">European
Extremely Large Telescope</a> (39-meters or 1530-in).  The ELT is now
under construction in Chile, but the TMT is embroiled in a dispute
over environmental and cultural impacts at its preferred Mauna Kea
site.  The
<a href="http://www.gmto.org/">Giant Magellan Telescope</a>
(at right), also
under construction in Chile, is a multiple-mirror design with
7 8.4-meter spin-cast mirrors and an equivalent collecting area
of a single 22-meter mirror.  The combined primary mirror
surface is parabolic, and the six off-axis segments are
asymmetrically aspheric and difficult to figure. </p>

Another large telescope with a very different design and operations
mode is the <a href="http://www.lsst.org">Rubin Observatory Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope</a>.  To achieve a wide field of view (3.5<sup>o</sup>) it
employs a <a href="im/LSST-optical-design.png">unique 3-mirror
design</a> in which the primary and tertiary mirrors have been figured
on a single piece of spin-cast glass 8.4-meters in diameter.  The
telescope is intended to repeatedly image the entire usable sky every
three nights, searching for transient or moving targets while building
up an ultra-deep combined image of the sky.  Continuous output from
its 189 imaging CCDs will generate an unprecedented data volume (15
TB/night).  Under construction in Chile, LSST should begin full
operations in 2022.  </p>

The <a href="https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/">James Webb Space
Telescope</a> is the follow-on to HST.  It features a 6.5-m diameter
primary mirror (a 25 square meter collecting area, 5.5 times that of
HST) composed of 18 hexagonal segments that must be deployed on-orbit.
JWST carries four imaging and spectroscopic instruments and is
optimized for the near-infrared (1-30 &#181;).  It will achieve the
same spatial resolution in the NIR as HST does in the UV-optical band.
A large sunshield permits a low overall structural operating
temperature through cooling to space.  JWST will orbit around the
Earth-Sun L<sub>2</sub> point, about 900,000 km from Earth.
Instrument and main optics testing has been completed, but integration
of the telescope with its spacecraft encountered quality-control
problems in 2018.  Launch is now scheduled for 2021. </p>
