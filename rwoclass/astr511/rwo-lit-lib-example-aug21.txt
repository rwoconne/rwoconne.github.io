               SIMPLE UNIX "ASCII LITERATURE LIBRARY" 

METHOD: 

   1)  Sign up for daily mailings of newly submitted abstracts from
       arXiv.org

   2)  arXiv sends a single composite ASCII (text) file of abstracts
       received during the last 24 hours (M-F).  You can read it from
       your mailer or save it to your computer to read later.

   3)  Copy individual abstracts of interest and paste each into an
       ASCII file with a title containing the lead author's name, a
       compressed description, and the year.  I use a ".abs" suffix
       for clarity.

       Optionally do light editing on the abstract: e.g. breaking the
       usual indigestible block of text into separate paragraphs or
       capitalizing key items.

   4)  Store files in topic-oriented directories.  In some cases, it's
       useful to cross-index files by storing them under several
       topics.  You could also use soft links to do that.  

   5)  You can read, annotate, search, list, rename, grep, sort,
       combine, or hardcopy files with simple UNIX commands using the
       Terminal.  The "more" command to display content doesn't care
       about an ASCII file's suffix.  Terminal display and
       manipulation of files is faster and cleaner than dealing with
       PDF, Word, or other proprietary formats.
    
   6)  Download full PDF versions only of papers that appear
       particularly relevant or important.  The URL for the PDF is
       contained in the abstract file.

   7)  If you don't want to be bothered with daily mailings, you can
       use the same technique directly on the arXiv.org listings as
       viewed in a browser, although this is less convenient, more
       time consuming, and requires you to take the initiative.
       
   8)  This method allows you to search/organize literature files by
       author, date, and title.  You can add additional special
       keywords to files to help find or organize them in the form of
       "tags."  Most popular operating systems support the use of
       arbitrary tags.  MacOS offers a robust system.  The content of
       files is not changed: instead, tags are associated with them as
       metadata by the file management system.  One problem with this
       feature is that although the files themselves are portable,
       metadata may not survive a migration to another computer or
       operating system.

   9)  You can embed BibTex-like entries in the files, but that
       involves an extra step.

Post-starburst galaxies are crucial to disentangling the effect of
star formation and quenching on galaxy demographics. They comprise,
however, a heterogeneous population of objects, described in numerous
ways. To obtain a well-defined and uncontaminated sample, we take
advantage of spatially resolved spectroscopy to construct an
unambiguous sample of E + A galaxies - post-starburst systems with no
observed ongoing star formation.  Using data from the Mapping Nearby
Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) Survey, in the fourth
generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV), we have
identified 30 E + A galaxies that lie within the green valley of
color-stellar mass space.  

We first identified E + A candidates by their central, single-fiber
spectra and (u-r) color from SDSS DR15, and then further required each
galaxy to exhibit E + A properties throughout the entirety of the
system to three effective radii.  We describe our selection criteria
in detail, note common pitfalls in E + A identification, and introduce
the basic characteristics of the sample. We will use this E + A
sample, which has been assembled with stringent criteria and thus
re-establishes a well-defined subpopulation within the broader
category of post-starburst galaxies, to study the evolution of
galaxies and their stellar populations in the time just after star
formation within them is fully quenched.
