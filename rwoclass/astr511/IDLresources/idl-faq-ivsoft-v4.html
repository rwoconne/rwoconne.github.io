These questions pop up fairly regularly in thenewsgroup <B>comp.lang.idl-pvwave</B>. This list is an attempt to cutdown on net traffic regarding commonly asked questions. Users areencouraged to read through this list before posting a query to thenewsgroup.</P><P>As of 1997 May 15 Mike Schienle has been maintaining the IDL FAQ.Ray Sterner was handling this previously, and Mike Schienle beforehim and Patrick Ryan before him; much of the material and many of thecomments here were compiled by them.</P><DL>   <DT>A Note from the editor about PV~WAVE:</DT>      <DD>I have nearly as much experience with PV~WAVE as I do with   IDL, and was maintaing the PV-WAVE FAQ at one time. I felt   obligated to cease maintaining the PV-WAVE FAQ when I began some   contract work for RSI. I will try to minimize comments which   appear to favor one package or the other. If someone is interested   in maintaining the PV-WAVE FAQ please contact me.</DD></DL><H2>Contents</H2><P>This list is roughly divided into two categories: <B>generalquestions</B> and <B>technical questions</B>.

What is IDL?</H3><P>IDL is the Interactive Data Language. It is a product of ResearchSystems, Inc. (RSI).</P><P>The following is quoted from the README file atrsinc.com:/pub/idl/README. As such, it describes IDL's capabilitiesin an understandably subjective manner. ;-)</P><BLOCKQUOTE>IDL, Interactive Data analysis Language, is a complete   package for the interactive reduction, analysis, and visualization   of scientific data and images. Optimized for the workstation   environment, IDL integrates a responsive array oriented language   with numerous data analysis methods and an extensive variety of   two and three dimensional displays into a powerful tool for   researchers.      <P>IDL supports an extensive data import capability, publication   quality hard copy output, and user-defined Motif graphical user   interfaces.</P>      <P>Users can create complex visualizations in hours instead of   weeks with the aid of IDL's high level capabilities and   interactive environment.</P>      <P>IDL is useful in physics, astronomy, image and signal   processing, mapping, medical imaging, statistics, and other   technical disciplines requiring visualization of large amounts of   data.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Here is a short history of RSI:<BR>&#91;attributed to ali@rsinc.com (Ali Bahrami)&#93;</P><BLOCKQUOTE>IDL is a product of Research Systems, Inc., founded in   1977 by David Stern. The origins of IDL were developed at the   Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) at the   University of Colorado. David was one of the people involved in   efforts to make computers easier to use for the physicists at the   Lab. The first program in the evolutionary chain to IDL was named   Rufus (named after Dave's dog). Rufus was a very simple vector   oriented calculator that ran on the PDP-12. It accepted 2 letter   codes that specified (1) An arithmetic operation (2) The input   registers to serve as operands, and (3) the destination register.   The next version was the Mars Mariner Spectrum Editor (MMED) which   was a version of Rufus that ran on the PDP-8.      <P>The next program in this line was named SOL, and it also ran on   the PDP-8. Unlike its predecessors, SOL was a real computer   language with a real syntax (no more 2 letter codes). It was an   APL influenced array oriented language with some primitive   graphics capabilities. The resemblance to IDL was there, but very   faintly.</P>      <P>In 1977, Dave left LASP to start Research Systems Inc. (RSI)   with the intention of building on the ideas contained in SOL. The   initial result of this endeavor was PDP-11 IDL, which was much   more capable than SOL. Graphics was usually done on Tektronix   terminals and outboard raster graphics displays. I used this   version at LASP in 1981 on a PDP11/34 under RSX-11M in 1981 (I   worked as a student at LASP from 1981 to 1987). I didn't use it   for very long though, because 1981 was the year that Dave released   the VAX/VMS version of IDL. This version, which was written in   VAX-11 MACRO and FORTRAN, took advantage of the VAX virtual memory   and 32-bit address space, and was a huge step beyond the PDP-11   version. It used essentially the same sort of graphics hardware as   the PDP-11.</P>      <P>In 1987, Dave decided that Unix workstations were the direction   in which IDL should progress, but porting the current VAX IDL to   Unix didn't make much sense because of its MACRO and FORTRAN   implementation. I had just finished my Masters degree and was   looking for work. Dave hired me and together we wrote the current   version of IDL for Unix on the Sun 3 taking advantage of the   re-write to extend and improve the language. Since then, we've   ported it to many Unix machines and moved it back to VMS. RSI has   many other employees now, but our focus is still the continued   development of IDL. Recently, IDL was ported to PC class systems   running Microsoft Windows.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><HR><A NAME=G02></A></P><H3>G02.

What is PV~WAVE and how is it related to IDL?</H3><P>Around the time that the Unix version of IDL first becameavailable (1988), Precision Visuals Inc. (PVI) entered into anagreement with RSI under which they enhanced and resold IDL under thename PV~WAVE. In September of 1990, they exercised an option in thatagreement that resulted in the following:</P><P>- They received a copy of the IDL source code as it existed inSeptember 1990 in return for a one-time payment to RSI.</P><P>- The connection between RSI and PVI was severed.</P><P>IDL and PV~WAVE are now on separate development tracks. Eachcompany enhances, supports, and maintains its own product.</P><P>PVI has since merged with IMSL and is now <A HREF="http://www.vni.com/">VisualNumerics, Inc.</A> (VNI).<HR><A NAME=G07></A></P><H3>G07.

Why are there two newsgroups for IDL?</H3><P>Unfortunately, there are two very different packages with theabbreviation "IDL". The newsgroup comp.lang.idl is for the InterfaceDefinition Language, but has been somewhat superseded by theOMG-related newsgroup <A HREF="news://comp.object.corba">comp.object.corba</A>.The newsgroup for discussing issues related to RSI's IDL and VNI'sPV~WAVE and IMSL/IDL is <A HREF="news://comp.lang.idl-pvwave"><B>comp.lang.idl-pvwave</B></A>.</P><P>The Interface Definition Language is part of the Common ObjectRequest Broker Architecture (CORBA), a distributed computingspecification from the Object Management Group (OMG). For moredetails, see <A HREF="http://www.omg.org/">http://www.omg.org/</A>,or the newsgroup <A HREF="news://comp.object.corba">comp.object.corba</A>.</P><P><HR><A NAME=G10></A></P><H3>G10. Does anyone at RSI read this group? Is anyone therelistening?</H3><P>&#91; This question was included at the request of RSI. The answerwas provided by Ali Bahrami. -pat &#93;</P><BLOCKQUOTE>Yes, many of us do. We're naturally curious what people   think of our product. We make notes about what people like and   dislike and this influences our decisions.      <P>However, you usually won't get a direct response from us from a   posting to this group. There are many reasons for this. Here are a   couple of the more important ones:</P>      <P>We believe that this group should belong solely to the user   community, and should be free of vendor bias and marketing. It   should be noted that both RSI and Visual Numerics (formerly PVI)   have shown great restraint in this matter, and that this group is   largely left to the actual users. (Long term readers will recall   some notable exceptions to this, but in general it is true.)</P>      <P>It could be argued that as long as the topic stays technical,   vendor postings are OK. The problem with this is that one persons   technical posting is another's blatant product plug, and the line   between them is not always obvious.</P>      <P>We provide support for our customers via the phone and email.   If you would like an answer from us, you should call us directly.   We have no objection to you sharing the information you get in   this manner with the newsgroup as long as you quote us accurately   and separate fact from conjecture.</P>      <P>In other words, you should view this newsgroup as a way to   share questions and information with other users, not as a way to   contact the vendor.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><HR><A NAME=G11></A></P><H3>G11.

How do I increase the number of commands stored in thehistory buffer?</H3><P>The system variable !EDIT_INPUT controls command recall. Bydefault, it is set to 1, causing the last 20 commands to be saved. Ifit is 0, no commands are saved. To save more than 20 commands, justput !EDIT_INPUT=50 (or other large number) in your startup file.</P><P>It is important to realize that IDL looks at the value of!EDIT_INPUT the first time it reads anything from the keyboard, andthe size of the history buffer is fixed after that. Hence, thecommand must be in a startup file because entering it at the keyboardis too late.<HR><A NAME=T03></A></P><H3>T03.

Does anybody know how to put multiple image plots on onepage in PostScript?</H3><P>Because PostScript has scalable pixels, you must specify the xsizeand ysize parameters, as well as the position parameter, in TV orTVSCL. I don't know about PV-Wave, but the following works inIDL:</P><PRE>  ; Display four images in a 2x2 grid  ; Assume data(x,y,4) = array containing the 4 images    set_plot, 'ps'           ;request PostScript output  device, ...              ;modify page size, orientation, etc. as desired  ximsize = 0.5*!d.x_size  ;define output image size  yimsize = 0.5*!d.y_size  ;note: 0.5 assumes 2x2 grid  for i=0,3 do begin       ;display the 4 images, using i as position index     tv, data(*,*,i), i, xsize=ximsize, ysize=yimsize  endfor</PRE><P><HR><A NAME=T13></A></P><H3>T13. Does case matter in IDL?</H3><P>No.</P><P>Compiled routines are case insensitive. The only catch is that, onUnix systems, when executing a script via the .RUN command, the filename argument must exactly match the file name as it appears on thedisk. Once the routines in the script are compiled, their names canbe written in any case. This is not a problem in operating systemssuch as VMS that do not distinguish case for file names. This isusually not a problem under Unix either since, by convention, mostpeople use lower case file names.</P><P>Sometimes.</P><P>Case matters when you are doing string comparisons. Comparing"IDL" to "idl" will return a false.</P><P><HR><A NAME=T14></A></P><H3>T14. How do I set up IDL to get precise control over plot windowand text positioning with either portrait or landscape pageorientation on a PostScript or HP-GL printer?</H3><P>(This answer only applies to PostScript and HP-GL printers --other printers may differ in having the X and Y offsets measured fromthe upper left corner of the portrait page instead of the lower leftcorner.)</P><P>IDL uses portrait page orientation as a default. (The x axis isalong the shorter dimension of the paper.) In portrait orientationthe lower left corner of the page is the origin for the XOFFSET andYOFFSET page offsetting keywords of the DEVICE command that determinethe origin (lower left corner) of the output window. (Normally oneuses XOFFSET=0 and YOFFSET=0 for portrait orientation.) Size of theoutput window is determined by the XSIZE and YSIZE keywords of theDEVICE command. The origin for graph positioning variables!P.POSITION and !P.REGION is the output window origin. X and Ycoordinates for portrait page orientation are shown on the sketchbelow as upper case X and Y.</P><PRE>      ----------      |        |   ORIGINAL PORTRAIT PAGE  (Printer only prints on    Y |        |         OUTPUT WINDOW                  this area.)      |        |      |   X    |      o-----------      |    y   + |   OUTPUT WINDOW ROTATED ABOUT LOWER LEFT CORNER    x |        + |      |        + |      ------------      ++++++++++    OUTPUT WINDOW RESIZED FOR LANDSCAPE ORIENTATION           ^           |    DIRECTION OF NEEDED OFFSET&nbsp;</PRE><P>If device,/landscape is specified, then the output window isrotated 90 deg. clockwise about the lower left corner of the page. Inthis condition nothing will be plotted on the page, since therotation has carried the output window entirely off the paper asshown in the sketch above. To correct this mismatch, the rotatedoutput window must be offset. XOFFSET AND YOFFSET are still measuredin the X and Y coordinates of the portrait page, but now representthe position of the lower left corner of the rotated (and resized)output window (marked by an o above) with respect to the lower leftcorner of the portrait (actual) page. Hence, one generally usesXOFFSET=0 and YOFFSET=long_dimension_of_page for landscapeorientation.</P><P>In landscape orientation, the coordinates for graph positioningvariables !P.POSITION and !P.REGION are the lower case x and ycoordinates shown in the sketch above and having origin marked by theletter o. Position of output window origin o on the page is, ofcourse, affected by the setting of XOFFSET and YOFFSET, as explainedbefore. The XSIZE and YSIZE (output window size) keywords of theDEVICE command are also measured in the x and y directions when inlandscape orientation. The resizing of the landscape page generallymeans interchanging the values of XSIZE and YSIZE appropriate for theportrait page.</P><P>Example of settings for a portrait page:</P><PRE>  XPAGE=8.5  &amp;  YPAGE=11.  &amp;  XOFFS=0.  &amp;  YOFFS=0.  ;Inches  DEVICE,/INCHES,XSIZE=XPAGE,YSIZE=YPAGE,XOFFSET=XOFFS,YOFFSET=YOFFS&nbsp;</PRE><P>Example of settings for a landscape page:</P><PRE>  XPAGE=11.  &amp;  YPAGE=8.5  &amp;  XOFFS=0.  &amp;  YOFFS=XPAGE  ;Inches  DEVICE,/LANDSCAPE,/INCHES,XSIZE=XPAGE,YSIZE=YPAGE,XOFFSET=XOFFS, $       YOFFSET=YOFFS&nbsp;</PRE><P>Example of setting position and size of a plot window:</P><PRE>  X0=1.374  &amp;  Y0=1.283  &amp;  XLEN=3.622  &amp;  YLEN=6.157  ;Inches  !P.POSITION=&#91;X0/XPAGE,Y0/YPAGE,(X0+XLEN)/XPAGE,(Y0+YLEN)/YPAGE&#93;&nbsp;</PRE><P>Example of setting position and orientation of a text string:</P><PRE>  x0=.35  &amp;  y0=.37  ;Inches  xyouts,x0/xpage,y0/ypage,!stime,orient=90,/normal     ;Date, time&nbsp;</PRE><P><HR><A NAME=T15></A></P><H3>T15. I get the error message "Code Area Full". What do I do?</H3><P>IDL sets aside a certain amount of memory area for compilingprograms.

After   successful compilation, a new memory are of the required size is   allocated to contain the newly compiled program unit.      <P>Resizing the code and data areas erases the currently compiled   main program and all mail program variables.

How can I get IDL and MacX to work without crashing?</H3><P>Using MacX v1.2 and IDL cause the Mac to crash quite often. Thishappens especially during allocation of color resources or displaywindows. You can get around the problem by downgrading to MacX v1.1.7(apparently Apple will supply this if you can prove to them that yourightfully own v1.2). Another solution is to purchase White Pine'seXodus software. Rumors are that eXodus is an overall better productthan MacX.

How can I determine if a variable is defined?</H3><P>It is often useful to determine if an IDL variable is defined.This is easily done using the <B><TT>n_elements</TT></B> functionwhich returns 0 if the given variable is undefined. This isespecially useful for setting defaults for keyword parameters. Hereare several examples:</P><P><TT>if n_elements(start) eq 0 then start=0</TT></P><P><TT>if n_elements(dir) eq 0 then cd, current=dir</TT><HR><A NAME=T21></A></P><H3>T21. Why should KEYWORD_SET not be used to check if a variable isdefined?</H3><P>From Bill Thompson:</P><P>The IDL function KEYWORD_SET() is only designed to be used withlogical variables, i.e. those which can be either True (usuallysignalled with the value 1) or False (0). It has the property that ifa variable is undefined, then it returns False, so people often makethe mistake of using it to test whether a variable is defined ornot.</P><P>To test whether a variable is defined or not, use N_ELEMENTS()instead. This will return 0 if a variable is undefined, or somepositive number otherwise. Only use KEYWORD_SET for truly Boolean(True/False) variables.<HR><A NAME=T22></A></P><H3>T22. What is the undocumented routine TVRDC?</H3><P>From a <TT>comp.lang.idl-pvwave</TT> post by William Thompson:</P><P>The reason that TVRDC is undocumented is because it's not neededany more. It doesn't do anything that CURSOR doesn't do. TVRDC isonly retained for compatibility with older programs.</P><P>In the old days, before X-windows, CURSOR was used to readcoordinates off of line graphics terminals, and TVRDC was used toread coordinates off of image display devices. With the advent of IDL2.0, the distinctions between different kinds of graphics deviceswere mostly removed, and both of these functions were merged intoCURSOR.<HR><A NAME=T23></A></P><H3>T23.

GIF images are widely used on the World Wide Web,JPEG is also supported by some web browsers. TIFF may be needed forpublishing purposes.<HR><A NAME=T25></A></P><H3>T25. Why don't my desktop PC applications recognize the previewportion of IDL EPSI files?</H3><P>By Troy Klein, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab</P><P>Quoting the IDL version 4.0 online help for the PREVIEW keyword,"Set this keyword to add a 'device independent screen preview' to thePostScript output file, in encapsulated PostScript interchange format(<B>EPSI</B>). Use this keyword only with encapsulated output. Many,but certainly not all, desktop publishing and word processingprograms will display this screen preview when the file is importedinto a document."</P><P>The EPSI format is not compatible with some of the more popularWindows and Macintosh applications. Windows applications expect thepreview image to be in TIFF format and Macintosh applications expectthe preview image to be in PICT format and in the resource fork ofthe EPS file. I have found the EPSI file to be compatable withFramemaker for UNIX/X windows.</P><P>There are two workarounds available for Mac users and two forWindows users, all are similar. If you are using IDL on a UNIXmachine, there is a package available (as of 8/2/95) on the popularUniversity of Michigan Mac shareware/freeware archive (use the mirrorsite at <B>ftp://mirrors.aol.com</B>) titled "<B>ps2epsmac</B>",which uses <B>Ghostscript</B> and <B>NetPBM</B> on a UNIX machine tointerpret the postscript and create a new EPS file in Macbinaryformat with the PICT preview. There are several Mac programsavailable (<B>StuffitExpander</B>, <B>Fetch</B>, etc.) to interpretthe Macbinary file. I have had great success in using this method toimport IDL EPS files into Word, Powerpoint, and MacDraw Pro. There isa similar package at the archive titled "<B>ps2epsplus</B>" whichdoes the same thing, but all on a Mac.</P><P>For UNIX IDL users trying to import IDL EPS files into Windowsapplications, there is a package called "<B>ps2epsf</B>" which can belocated using an Archie search. This package essentially does thesame thing as the UNIX/Mac package but produces an EPS file with aTIFF preview. The second solution for Windows users is the Windowsapplicationi <B>GSview</B> (which can also be found with archie).Version 1.2 claims to be capable of adding preview images to EPSfiles.<HR><A NAME=T26></A></P><H3>T26.

Why is memory not released back to the operating systemafter an array is deleted?</H3><P>By <A HREF="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/finger/mofo.ssl.berkeley.edu/korpela/w">Eric Korpela</A> of Berkeley</P><P>This is a result of IDL being written in C and using the C libraryfunctions (malloc and free) for memory allocation. In most Clibraries, memory that is freed is NOT returned to the operatingsystem. The C program retains this memory and will reuse it forfuture calls to malloc (assuming that the new allocation will fit inthe freed block).</P><P>Another way of considering it is in terms of how memory allocationis done under UNIX. New memory is allocated using brk() or sbrk()which control the size of the data segment. These routines are calledby malloc().</P><PRE>Suppose you allocate 3 1 MB regions of memory under C.&nbsp;char *p1=(char *)malloc(3*1024*1024);char *p2=(char *)malloc(3*1024*1024);char *p3=(char *)malloc(3*1024*1024);&nbsp;Here's what your data segment would look like assuming malloc had to call sbrk().&nbsp;---------------------------------------------------------------prev stuff | overhead | 3MB | overhead | 3MB | overhead | 3MB |---------------------------------------------------------------                      ^                ^                ^     ^                      p1               p2               p3    end of segment.&nbsp;Now we free(p1).&nbsp;----------------------------------------------------------------prev stuff | overhead | free | overhead | 3MB | overhead | 3MB |----------------------------------------------------------------                                        ^                ^     ^                                        p2               p3    end of segment&nbsp;</PRE><P>Notice that the free memory is still in the data segment. If freehad called brk to reduce the size of the segment, the 3MB pointed tomy p3 would be outside the data segment! SIGSEGV city! If free hadmoved the allocated memory to lower addresses so the segment sizecould be reduced without losing data, then p2 and p3 would point toinvalid addresses, and we'd be forced to use handles rather thanpointers and call GetPointerFromHandle() every time we wanted toaccess the memory.

Why do color bars in PostScript not look as good as on thescreen?</H3><P>By default IDL uses 4 bits per pixel when displaying images inPostScript. This gives only 16 possible gray shades or colors as maybe seen by the following example commands:</P><PRE>a = rebin(bindgen(256),256,50)        ; Create a color bar.set_plot,'ps'                         ; Set PostScript mode.device,/color                         ; Specify color PostScript.loadct,4                              ; Load a color table.tv,a,0,0,xs=12.8,ys=2.5,/centimeters  ; Display bar.device,/close                         ; Close PostScript file (idl.ps).$gs idl.ps                            ; Send to a color PS printer or use                                      ; a PostScript viewer to see results.&nbsp;</PRE><P>Replace first call to device above by:</P><PRE>device,/color,bits_per_pixel=8&nbsp;</PRE><P>This simple change may fix a number of problems with colorPostScript. By the way, you will need to use <B>/inches</B> or<B>/centimeters</B> on a <B>tv</B> or <B>tvscl</B> command to get thedesired results. This applies to both the position and sizes of theimage. By default these are in pixels and PostScript has a lot ofpixels as may be seen by doing <B>help,/structure,!d</B> after<B>set_plot,'ps'</B>.

Does anyone know how to ensure vector-drawn fonts look good(and similar) across different X11 servers?</H3><P>By Liam Gumley, Space Science and Engineering Center, Universityof Wisconsin-Madison</P><P>The fix I came up with goes as follows. Put the following commandsin an IDL startup file (they must be executed immediately after IDLstartup):</P><PRE>device,retain=2,pseudo=8         ; 8 bit display with backing storewindow,/free,/pixmap,colors=-5   ; Create window to allocate colorsplot,&#91;0&#93;                         ; Might not be needed, but won't hurt wdelete,!d.window                ; Delete the windowdevice,set_character_size=&#91;6,9&#93;  ; Set the vector font sizeprint, 'Number of colors allocated is ', !d.n_colors&nbsp;</PRE><P>If you use this in your startup file, then you should not need anyentries in your $HOME/.Xdefaults file. The only command I have in$HOME/.Xdefaults is</P><PRE>Idl*fontlist: screen16&nbsp;</PRE><P>which sets the font used for widgets (unrelated to the graphicsvector font).</P><P>As RSI technical support explained it to me, the default graphicsvector font size is 6x9 at startup. However as soon as you open agraphics window, that font size may be changed (why, I don't know).So the only way to guarantee that you get 6x9 vector fonts is to usethe commands above immediately after startup. Please note that youare not guaranteed to get 256 colors allocated to IDL 4.01 if you usethe colors=-5 keyword (I usually get about 170 colors on my SGI). OnSGI boxes with 24 bit graphics, setting colors=256 usually gets you256 colors, but this won't work on all Unix boxes. The IDL 5.0pre-release seems to be a bit smarter (at least on an SGI), and evenif you set colors=-5, it allocates 256 colors.</P><P><HR><A NAME=T30></A></P><H3>T30.

This was in response to the documentation for HDF_SD_GETDATA, sothat context has been left in the explanation.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>IDL stores information in a row-order format. That is to   say that in memory row elements are contiguous. HDF apparently   stores information in a column-order format, so that column   elements are contiguous.      <P>Does this matter? Most of the time, not a whit. It has nothing   to do with how columns or rows are specified in variables, or   whether the column notation is first or second. Where it does   matter is if you are doing something in a loop. If data is stored   row-ordered and you loop over a column index, the loop can be   quite slow, since you have to grab successive chunks of memory   that are not next to each other.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Shortly afterwards, William B. Clodius provided much greaterdetail on the subject.</P><BLOCKQUOTE>There are four different aspects of arrays, how they are   stored in memory, how they are accessed by the language, how   matrices are mapped to arrays, and how they are displayed on the   screen.      <OL>      <LI>Memory storage: Many of the aspects of how they are stored      in memory are determined by the OS/processor which provides      blocks of memory with optimal alignment properties. Any      sensible single processor implementation of arrays will try to      lay out all elements of the array in one contiguous block for      efficient access. (Many languages restrict this block to the      heap, but some allow stack allocation). An array oriented      language, e.g., APL, IDL, Algol 68, Fortran 90/95, will also      create a small descriptor defining the layout.</LI>            <LI>Array access: Because contiguous elements are usually more      efficiently accessed than non-contiguous elements, and most      languages want to make it easy for users to implement efficient      code, most languages define a mapping of array elements to      memory locations in the block. Historically, it is this mapping      that is usually described by the terms column major versus row      major. I am not certain how this convention started. Under this      definition both IDL and Fortran are column major.</LI>            <LI>Matrices are mathematical constructs that can be      efficiently implemented as arrays with special operations. The      mapping of matrices onto arrays in IDL and Fortran may be      different, but I have not looked in detail at this. The      interpretation of this mapping depends on whether a vector by      default is described as a row or column vector. While using the      wrong convention with a given language would be a source of      error, using the correct convention should be of comparable      efficiency. Note, however, that IDL does not discuss matrices      in its discussion of its array naming convention.</LI>            <LI>Array display: Many (most) languages (including C and      Fortran) are not concerned with the display of arrays. Such a      display for these languages is only defined by external library      packages, and can follow the library's arbitrary conventions. A      sensible package would map display lines to the most efficient      access method, I.e., the last index for C, the first index for      Fortran. The IDL language defines the same mapping as an      efficient library for Fortran, each line mapping to a different      value of the second index.</LI>   </OL></BLOCKQUOTE><P>William Thompson adds the following (minor editing/formatting byM. Schienle to keep this from becoming a novel):</P><BLOCKQUOTE>In order to make the above statement "IDL stores   information in a row-order format", you first have to define what   is meant by a row and by a column in terms of IDL matrices.   Personally, for matrices, I tend to assume that the first   dimension is the row and the second dimension is the column, and   would thus agree with that statement. However, the original poster   was using the opposite convention, and had a good reason for doing   so.      <P>From all the mail messages on the subject, I think that the   following facts can be derived:</P>      <OL>      <LI>IDL stores arrays such that the leftmost dimension is the      most rapidly changing. This means that in memory, the array      element A(0,0) is followed by A(1,0), and then A(2,0), etc. up      until A(N-1,0) which is followed by A(0,1), and so on.</LI>            <LI>Fortran stores arrays using the same convention as IDL,      except that indices start with 1 rather than 0.</LI>            <LI>C stores arrays such that the rightmost dimension is the      most rapidly changing. In other words, A&#91;0&#93;&#91;0&#93;      is followed by A&#91;0&#93;&#91;1&#93; up to      A&#91;0&#93;&#91;N-1&#93;, which is then followed by      A&#91;1&#93;&#91;0&#93; and so on.</LI>            <LI>Standard software written in C and Fortran both map      matrices onto 2D arrays such that the left dimension is the row      and the right dimension is the column. However, the storage of      these matrices in memory would be different.</LI>            <LI>The mapping of matrices onto arrays in IDL appears to      depend on what software is used. The original # array      multiplication operator assumes that the first dimension is the      row dimension and the second dimension is the column dimension.      With this convention, IDL treats matrices like Fortran in both      notation and storage.<BR>      However, with the alternate ## array multiplication operator      introduced in IDL/v4.0 the opposite convention is used. I.e.      the ## operator assumes that the left dimension is the column      dimension and the right dimension is the row dimension. With      this convention, the internal storage of matrices matches that      of C, but the notation differs from both C and Fortran.</LI>            <LI>The most recent documentation from RSI appears to encourage      the use of the new ## operator over the original # operator. I      don't know if this is because there are other elements which      have been added to IDL which also assume a (column,row)      notation for matrices.</LI>            <LI>Data arrays in IDL are usually labelled such that the left      dimension is "X" and the second from the left is "Y". This is      the convention followed by graphics routines such as TVSCL and      CONTOUR, with X increasing to the left and Y increasing up. One      could also consider X to be the column and Y to be the row,      since that is how the data would be displayed.</LI>   </OL></BLOCKQUOTE><P><HR><A NAME=T39></A></P><H3>T39.
