<h1 align="center">FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS</h1>

<p><br></p>

This is a list of the most relevant non-departmental programs offering
funding, either basic or supplemental, for astronomy graduate
students.  Some require application no later than a student's first
year of graduate school.  </p>

<ul>

<a href="https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/about-doe-csgf"><b>Department
of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship</b></a>: Stipend
of $45000 plus tuition for up to 4 years.  Supports research involving
high performance computing in selected areas of science and
engineering, including astronomy.  Expectation of completing grad
courses in computer science and applied math.  Includes a 12-week
practicum at a DOE national lab.  Apply as first-year graduate
student.  One opportunity per year.</p>

<a href="http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/FordFellowships/PGA_047958"><b>Ford
Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship Program (NAS)</b></a>: Normally
awards about 65 fellowships per year across a broad range of fields,
including astronomy.  Stipend: $28000/yr for 3 years.  One opportunity
per year.  Must require a minimum of an additional 3 years of study
prior to PhD.  Predoctoral awards are not being made for 2024-25,
however a dissertation year fellowship is being offered.</p>

<a href="http://hertzfoundation.org/fellowships/fellowshipaward"><b>
Hertz Foundation Graduate Fellowship</b></a>: Stipend of $38000 plus
tuition for up to 5 years in selected areas of science and
engineering, including astronomy. About 10-15 awards per year.  Apply
as first-year graduate student.  Interview

Something has happened to the NAF as described here.  This
link is broken as is the link on the official NASA "Internships
and Fellowships" page.  There is a page called the NASA
Fellowship Activity (https://www.nasa.gov/learning-resources/internship-programs/nasa-fellowships/), but it refers to training grants at Minority
Serving Institutions, part of the GEM consortium.  GEM is oriented
toward industry partnerships and doesn't list astronomy as being
supported.  It apparently accepts only URM applicants. 

So: the original NFA is kaput.  

<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/education/fellowships-scholarships/index.html"><b>
NASA (Education) Fellowship Activity</b></a>: Supports research
related to specific NASA programs in conjunction with a NASA Technical
Advisor.  Mandatory part-time work at a NASA center.  For available
projects, see list at end of solicitation document.  US citizenship
required.  Maximum
$55000/year.  One opportunity per year.</p>

from Astro Dept Grad Handbook instead.

institution for five years, and a minimum of one paid summer
