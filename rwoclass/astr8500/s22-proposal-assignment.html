As an exercise, we are asking each student to <b>draft a proposal</b>
to the <a href="http://vsgc.odu.edu"><b>Virginia Space Grant
Consortium</b></a> to support their own existing research project
(under ASTR 9995).</p>

The VSGC is a NASA program administered through this and other states
to support education in areas related to space science and technology.
It offers a <b>$6000 supplemental fellowship</b> to graduate students
who are working in these areas and who are already supported by their
universities.</p>

Our students have been quite successful at securing VSGC support.  This
year's deadline is already past, but this exercise will be excellent
practice if you are interested in applying in the future.  </p>

The VSGC Graduate STEM Research Fellowhip Program for 2022 is
described at <a href="http://vsgc.odu.edu/graduatefellowships/">this
link</a> [http://vsgc.odu.edu/graduatefellowships/] .</p>

A sample application form is
provided <a href="VGSC-application-form-sample-20.pdf"> here (PDF
file)</a>.  In time-honored fashion, the form is somewhat confusing
about what you are expected to supply. </p>

<b>Here's what you should do:</b></p>

<ol>

<li> If you submitted an actual VSGC proposal, ignore the rest of
    these instructions (except #10) and submit a PDF copy of that to
    me.</p>

<li> If not, create a <b>facsimile</b> of the important parts of the
    application form and fill out the various annoying box-entry
    boilerplate.
    </p>

<li>Include the sections that identify your faculty advisor but ignore
    the request for a second reference-writer.  You do not need to
    request a letter of reference from your advisor.</p>

<li>Write a brief personal <b>resume</b> according to the
    instructions.  This need not be a full-blown "CV," but if you
    already have prepared a CV, submit that.  See
    <a href="writing-CVs-RWO-A8500.html">this page</a> for tips on writing
    CV's. </p>

<li> Write a <b>brief statement</b> (not to exceed 750 words)
    describing "how your research <b>aligns with NASA's Mission
    Directorates</b>."  Since the real answer might be "not at all,"
    you may want to exercise some creative skill here. </p>

<li> Provide a title and a <b>research statement</b> explaining what you
    intend to do over the 12-month period covered by the award.
    Minimum 2 pages, maximum 3 pages.  Include references to the
    literature.  This description should be thoughtful and accurately
    reflect the status and intended goals of your own research.</p>

<ul>
General tips on writing proposals are given 
<a href="writing-proposals-RWO-A8500.html">here</a></p>
</ul>

</p>

<li> Write a <b>brief statement</b> (not to exceed 750 words) that
    describes your short and long term <b>career goals</b> (5 and 20 years)
    and how this research supports your goals.</p>

<li> Ignore the "additional comments" entry.</p>

<li> Produce a <b>PDF file</b> of all this material and turn it in to me
     by the deadline (TBD).   </p>

<li> Prepare an <b>8 min talk</b> on your proposal to present to the
    class using <b>slides</b> (PowerPoint or equivalent) to illustrate
    your research program.  (You should <b>rehearse</b> your talk to be sure
    it is no longer than 8 min.)</p>
