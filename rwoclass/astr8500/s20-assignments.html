There will be four assignments this semester.  Only one will involve
a written submission, but three will involve a presentation
to the class using PowerPoint or the equivalent.
</p>

You should think of your participation in this course not just as a
requirement to be discharged but as an opportunity to build a set of
reference materials on the profession that will be useful to you,
other UVa graduate students, and potentially to the larger
astronomical community as well.</p>


<h2>A. Future of US Astronomy, A Debate</h2>

Dennis Overbye, one of the best popular science writers, suggested in
a recent New York Times column that US astronomy might be on the
verge of "losing the universe" because it is unlikely to be able to
compete directly with the
<a href="https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/eelt/">European Extremely
Large Telescope</a> (39-m aperture) now under construction in Chile.
Overbye's article is linked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/23/science/telescopes-magellan-hawaii-astronomy.html">here</a>. </p>

To provide some context for the rest of the semester, we will hold a
<b>discussion and debate</b> over the Overbye article during the
<b>January 28 meeting</b>.</p>

Students are asked to read the article and form themselves into two
teams: one to argue in favor of Overbye's claim and one to oppose it.
For definiteness, we will reformulate his claim as follows: </p>

<ul>

<font color="green"><b><em>"US astronomy will be at a significant
disadvantage in the next decade if it does not possess the largest
optical telescope in the world."</em></b></font></p>

</ul>

Team members don't necessarily have to agree with the point they are
defending, but everyone should have read Overbye and some of the
supporting literature that can be easily found on the Web concerning
the science cases and plans for the class of 20+ meter optical
telescopes.  You might read the public commentary attached to the
article to get a feel for general opinion (some informed,
some not) on the subject.  </p>

Teams should be roughly equal in size, and each should have an organizer
who will take the lead in seeing that the various aspects of the 
case are covered by the team.
No A/V presentations are expected.</p>

Everyone is expected to take part in the debate, and teams should
anticipate the main points of the other side and formulate rebuttals
to them.  </p>

Note that a real-life version of this debate is now playing out at the
highest levels of planning for the next decade of US astronomy in the
ongoing
<a href="https://sites.nationalacademies.org/DEPS/astro2020/index.htm">
2020 Decadal Study</a>.</p>

<h2>A. The "Dark Energy Debate"</h2>

To provide some context for the rest of the semester, students will be
asked to read two brief papers from <em>Reports on Progress in
Physics</em> that stimulated interesting controversy ten years ago.
The initial provocation was Simon White's article titled "Fundamental
Physics: Why Dark Energy is Bad for Astronomy."  A response from Rocky
Kolb titled "A Thousand Invisible Cords Binding Astronomy and
High-Energy Physics" appeared several months later.</p>

The issues --- including the intersection between the astronomy and
physics communities, funding constraints, specialized vs generalist
facilities, careers in the age of group science, and publication
metrics --- are just as timely now as they were then. </p>

Students should read and compare the two articles and be ready to
discuss them at the second and third class meetings.</p>

<ul>
<li> White: <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007RPPh...70..883W">
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007RPPh...70..883W</a></p>

<li> Kolb: <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007RPPh...70.1583K">

<h2>B. Faculty Top-10 Advice</h2>

Working in teams of 2 or 3, students will <b>interview</b> as many faculty
and senior researchers at UVa and NRAO as possible over a ~2 week
period to obtain their best advice for graduate students in the form
of the "top 10 things that grad students should know" in confronting
their careers.  Interviewees aren't obligated to offer you 10
suggestions, but they have been alerted to your visits, and we hope
they will be happy to participate and will have thought about the
topic ahead of time.</p>

The teams will divide up the interviewees as desired.  Each team will
consolidate the advice they receive into a <b>top-10 list</b>, which
they will <b>present</b> to the class in a brief (~8 minute) talk.
The class will consider and discuss all the presentations and arrive
at a final "top-10" <b>consensus list</b>.  </p>

We will need one (volunteer) student to act as coordinator and help
groups pick interviewees without duplications, provide contact
information, etc.</p>


<h2>C.  Proposal to the Virginia Space Grant Consortium</h2>

General considerations and advice concerning writing good proposals
will be covered in a class presentation.  As a realistic exercise,
each student will develop and write up a <b>proposal</b> to support
their ongoing ASTR 9995 research project in the form expected by
the <a href="http://vsgc.odu.edu/graduatefellowships/"> Virginia Space
Grant Consortium Graduate Research Fellowship</a> program.  That will
include writing a resume (or "CV").  Writeups will be submitted for
grading.  Each student will also <b>present</b> a brief (8-10 minute)
summary of their proposal to the class.</p>

<ul>

Details on writing the proposals are given
<a href="s20-proposal-assignment.html"> here</a>.

</ul>


<h2> D. Presentation on Optional Topic</h2>

Each student will select an optional topic related to the course for a
10-12 minute <b>presentation</b> during the last third of the semester.  I
will provide a <a href="s20-optional-topics.html">list of possible
topics</a>, but students can suggest others. </p>

After presentations made under items (C) and (D), the audience will
provide constructive feedback using <b>written evaluation forms</b>.
Copies (PDF files) of presentations, including lists of resources,
will be posted on the ASTR 8500 public website. </p>

<!--
Presenters will also be expected to create a <b>webpage</b> (in HTML) that
contains a PDF file of their digital presentation and copies of or links
to important supporting materials.  These will be posted on the course
website.</p>
