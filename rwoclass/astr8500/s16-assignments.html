There will be three assignments this semester.  Only one will involve
a written submission, but all three will involve a presentation
to the class using PowerPoint or an equivalent digital presentation
system.  </p>

You should think of your participation in this course not just as a
requirement to be discharged but as an opportunity to build a set of
reference materials on professional development that will be useful to
all graduate students here and in the outside world as well.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2>A. Faculty Top-10 Advice</h2>

Working in teams of 2 or 3, students will <b>interview</b> as many faculty
and senior researchers at UVa and NRAO as possible over a ~3 week
period to obtain their best advice for graduate students in the form
of the "top 10 things that grad students should know" in confronting
their careers.  Interviewees aren't obligated to offer you 10
suggestions, but they have been alerted to your visits, and we hope
they will be happy to participate and will have thought about the
topic ahead of time.</p>

The teams will divide up the interviewees as desired.  Each team will
consolidate the advice they receive into a <b>top-10 list</b>, which they
will <b>present</b> to the class in a brief (8-10 minute) talk.  The class
will consider and discuss all the presentations and arrive at
a final "top-10" <b>consensus list</b>.  </p>


<h2>B.  Proposal to the Virginia Space Grant Consortium</h2>

General considerations and advice concerning writing good proposals
will be covered in a class presentation.  As a realistic exercise,
each student will develop and write up a <b>proposal</b> to support
their ongoing ASTR 9995 research project in the form expected by
the <a href="http://www.vsgc.odu.edu/sf/gradfellow/"> Virginia Space
Grant Consortium Graduate Research Fellowship</a> program.  That will
include writing a resume (or "CV").  Writeups will be submitted for
grading.  Each student will also <b>present</b> a brief (8-10 minute)
summary of their proposal to the class.</p>

<ul>

More details on writing the proposals are given
<a href="s16-proposal-assignment.html"> here</a>.

</ul>


<h2> C. Presentation on Optional Topic</h2>

Each student will select an optional topic related to the course for a
10-12 minute <b>presentation</b> during the last third of the semester.  I
will provide a <a href="s16-optional-topics.html">list of possible
topics</a>, but students can suggest others. 
<a href="s16-opt-topics-sched.html">Here</a> is a list of the topics
chosen so far.
</p>

<p><br></p>

After presentations made under items (B) and (C), the audience will
provide constructive feedback using <b>written evaluation forms</b>.
Copies (PDF files) of presentations will be posted on the course
website. </p>

<!--
Presenters will also be expected to create a <b>webpage</b> (in HTML) that
contains a PDF file of their digital presentation and copies of or links
to important supporting materials.  These will be posted on the course
website.</p>
