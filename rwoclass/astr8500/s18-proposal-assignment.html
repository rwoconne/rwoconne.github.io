As an exercise, we are asking each student to <b>draft a proposal</b> to
the <a href="http://www.vsgc.odu.edu/sf/gradfellow/"><b>Virginia Space
Grant Consortium</b></a> to support their own existing research
project (under ASTR 9995).</p>

The VSGC is a NASA program administered through this and other states
to support education in areas related to space science and technology.
It offers a <b>$6000</b> supplemental fellowship to graduate students
who are working in these areas and who are already supported by their
universities.</p>

Our students have been quite successful at securing VSGC support.  This
year's deadline is already past, but this exercise will be excellent
practice if you are interested in applying in the future.  </p>

The VSGC program for 2018-19 is described <a href="VSGC-fellowship-program-18-19.pdf">
here (PDF file)</a>.</p>

A sample application form is provided <a href="VSGC-application-sample.pdf">
here (PDF file)</a>.  In time-honored tradition, the form is
somewhat confusing about what you are expected to supply. </p>

<b>Here's what you should do:</b></p>

<ol>

<li>Create a <b>facsimile</b> of the important parts of the application form
    and fill out the various annoying box-entry boilerplate.
    </p>

<li>Include the sections that identify your faculty advisor but ignore
    the request for a second reference-writer.  You do not need to
    request a letter of reference from your advisor.</p>

<li>Write a brief personal <b>resume</b> according to the
    instructions.  This need not be a full-blown "CV," but if you
    already have prepared a CV, submit that.  See
    <a href="writing-CVs-RWO-A8500.html">this page</a> for tips on writing
    CV's. </p>

<li> Write a <b>brief statement</b> (not to exceed 750 words)
    describing "how your research aligns with NASA's Mission
    Directorates."  Since the real answer in some cases might be "not
    at all," you may want to exercise some creative skill here. </p>

<li> Provide a title and a <b>research statement</b> explaining what you
    intend to do over the 12-month period covered by the award.
    Minimum 2 pages, maximum 3 pages.  Include references to the
    literature.  This description should be thoughtful and accurately
    reflect the status and intended goals of your own research.</p>

<ul>
General tips on writing proposals are given 
<a href="writing-proposals-RWO-A8500.html">here</a></p>
</ul>

</p>

<li> Write a <b>brief statement</b> (not to exceed 750 words) that
    describes your short and long term career goals (5 and 20 years)
    and how this research supports your goals.</p>

<li> Ignore the "additional comments" entry.</p>

<li> Produce a <b>PDF file</b> of all this material and turn it in to me
     by the deadline (TBD). </p>

<li> Prepare a 8-10 min <b>talk</b> on your proposal to present to the
    class using PowerPoint slides to illustrate your research
    program.  (You should rehearse your talk to be sure it is no
    longer than 10 min.)</p>
