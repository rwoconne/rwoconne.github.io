There will be four assignments this semester.  Only one will involve a
significant written submission, but three will involve a presentation
to the class using PowerPoint or the equivalent.
</p>

You should think of your participation in this course not just as a
requirement to be discharged but as an opportunity to build a set of
reference materials on the profession that will be useful to you,
other UVa graduate students, and potentially to the larger
astronomical community as well.</p>


<h2>A. Future of US Astronomy, A Debate</h2>

Dennis Overbye, one of the best popular science writers, suggested in
a 2020 New York Times column that US astronomy might be on the
verge of "losing the universe" because it is unlikely to be able to
compete directly with the
<a href="https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/eelt/">European Extremely
Large Telescope</a> (39-m aperture) now under construction in Chile.
Overbye's article is linked <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/23/science/telescopes-magellan-hawaii-astronomy.html"><b>here</b></a>. </p>

The US astronomical community has now produced a consensus set of
recommendations to its funding agencies for the coming decade in the
form of the Decadal Survey report 
<a href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/26141/pathways-to-discovery-in-astronomy-and-astrophysics-for-the-2020s">
<b><em>Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics for the
2020s</em></b></a>.  The Survey does not recommend building a telescope
that would directly compete with the EELT.  </p>

To provide some context for the rest of the semester, we will hold a
<b>discussion and debate</b> over the Overbye article during the
<b>February 8 meeting</b>.</p>

All students are asked to read the Overbye article and the relevant
sections of the Decadal report (Sec 7.6.1.1-7.6.1.2 and Appendix K) and
to skim the main recommendations of the report.  You might also read
the public commentary attached to the Overbye article to get a feel
for general opinion (some informed, some not) on the subject.  </p>

<!--  
and some of the
supporting literature that can be easily found on the Web concerning
the science cases for the class of 20+ meter optical telescopes.
-->

Then we ask that <b>8 students volunteer</b> to form themselves
into <b>two teams of 4 each</b>: one to argue in favor of Overbye's
claim and one to oppose it.  For definiteness, we will reformulate his
claim as follows: </p>

<ul>

<font color="green"><b><em>
 "Recommendations from the 2020 Decadal Study do
  not include a ground-based optical telescope larger than the
  European Extremely Large Telescope.  This will place
  US astronomy at a significant disadvantage over the next 20 years."
</em></b></font></p>

</ul>

The class is too large for everyone to participate directly in
the debate.  The 9 students who are not debaters will act as
<b>judges</b> and vote (by secret ballot) on the winners of the
debate.  They will be asked to justify their opinion in a <b>brief
written paragraph</b> submitted after class.</p>

We will spend about 20 minutes on the debate. </p>

Team members don't necessarily have to agree with the point they are
defending.  Each team should have an <b>organizer</b> who will take the lead
in seeing that the various aspects of the case are covered by the
team.  All team members are expected to take part in the debate, and
teams should anticipate the main points of the other side and
formulate rebuttals to them.  No A/V presentations are expected.</p>

To some extent you will be recreating the deliberations that took
place over the last couple of years by the 

<a href="https://sites.nationalacademies.org/DEPS/astro2020/index.htm">
Decadal Survey committees</a>.</p>

<h2>A. The "Dark Energy Debate"</h2>

To provide some context for the rest of the semester, students will be
asked to read two brief papers from <em>Reports on Progress in
Physics</em> that stimulated interesting controversy ten years ago.
The initial provocation was Simon White's article titled "Fundamental
Physics: Why Dark Energy is Bad for Astronomy."  A response from Rocky
Kolb titled "A Thousand Invisible Cords Binding Astronomy and
High-Energy Physics" appeared several months later.</p>

The issues --- including the intersection between the astronomy and
physics communities, funding constraints, specialized vs generalist
facilities, careers in the age of group science, and publication
metrics --- are just as timely now as they were then. </p>

Students should read and compare the two articles and be ready to
discuss them at the second and third class meetings.</p>

<ul>
<li> White: <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007RPPh...70..883W">
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007RPPh...70..883W</a></p>

<li> Kolb: <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007RPPh...70.1583K">
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007RPPh...70.1583K</a></p>
</ul>

<h2>B. Faculty Top-10 Advice</h2>

Working in teams of 4 or 5, students will <b>interview</b> as many
faculty and senior researchers at UVa and NRAO as possible over a ~2
week period to obtain their best advice for graduate students in the
form of the "top 10 things that grad students should know" in
confronting their careers, preferably in the context of the
recommendations from the 2020 Decadal survey.  Interviewees aren't
obligated to offer you 10 suggestions, but they have been alerted to
your visits, and we hope they will be happy to participate and will
have thought about the topic ahead of time.</p>

The teams will divide up the interviewees as desired.  Each team will
consolidate the advice they receive into a <b>top-10 list</b>, which
they will <b>present</b> to the class in a brief (~8 minute) talk.
The class will consider and discuss all the presentations and arrive
at a final "top-10" <b>consensus list</b>.  </p>

We will need one (volunteer) student to act as coordinator and help
groups pick interviewees without duplications, provide contact
information, etc.</p>


<h2>C.  Proposal to the Virginia Space Grant Consortium</h2>

General considerations and advice concerning writing good proposals
will be covered in a class presentation.  As a realistic exercise,
each student will develop and write up a <b>proposal</b> to support
their ongoing ASTR 9995 research project in the form expected by
the <a href="http://vsgc.odu.edu/graduatefellowships/"> Virginia Space
Grant Consortium Graduate Research Fellowship</a> program.  That will
include writing a resume (or "CV").  Writeups will be submitted for
grading.  Each student will also <b>present</b> a brief (8 minute)
summary of their proposal to the class.</p>

<ul>

Details on writing the proposals are given
<a href="s22-proposal-assignment.html"> here</a>.

</ul>


<h2> D. Presentation on Optional Topic</h2>

Each student will select an optional topic related to the course for a
8 minute <b>presentation</b> during the last third of the semester.  I
will provide a <a href="s22-optional-topics.html">list of possible
topics</a>, but students can suggest others. </p>

<p><br></p>

After presentations made under items (C) and (D), the audience will
provide constructive feedback using <b>written evaluation forms</b>.
Copies (PDF files) of presentations, including lists of resources,
will be posted on the ASTR 8500 public website. </p>

<!--
Presenters will also be expected to create a <b>webpage</b> (in HTML) that
contains a PDF file of their digital presentation and copies of or links
to important supporting materials.  These will be posted on the course
website.</p>
